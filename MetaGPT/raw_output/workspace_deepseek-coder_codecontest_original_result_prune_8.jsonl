You have to answer q queries. Each query consists of one integer, which is the value of k, and asks you to calculate the maximum possible total cost of items Monocarp can have after some sequence of trades, assuming that he can trade an item of cost x for an item of cost not greater than x+k during each trade. Note that the queries are independent: the trades do not actually occur, Monocarp only wants to calculate the maximum total cost he can get. Input The first line contains three integers n, m and q (1 ≤ n, m, q ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) — the prices of the items Monocarp has.

If there are several identical minima, Yelisey can choose any of them. 2. Then the selected minimal element is removed from the array. After that, m is subtracted from each remaining element. Thus, after each operation, the length of the array is reduced by 1. For example, if a = [1, 6, -4, -2, -4], then the minimum element in it is a_3 = -4, which means that after this operation the array will be equal to a=[1 {- (-4)}, 6 {- (-4)}, -2 {- (-4)}, -4 {- (-4)}] = [5, 10, 2, 0]. Since Yelisey likes big numbers, he wants the numbers in the array a to be as big as possible. Formally speaking, he wants to make the minimum of the numbers in array a to be maximal possible (i.e. he want to maximize a minimum). To do this, Yelisey can apply the minimum extraction operation to the array as many times as he wants (possibly, zero). Note that the operation cannot be applied to an array of length 1.

Unfortunately, all types of chocolates are distinct (all a_i are distinct). Icy wants to make at least one pair of chocolates the same type. As a result, she asks her grandparents to perform some chocolate exchanges. Before performing any chocolate exchanges, Icy chooses two chocolates with indices x and y (1 ≤ x, y ≤ n, x ≠ y). In a chocolate exchange, Icy's grandparents choose a non-negative integer k, such that 2^k ≥ a_x, and change the type of the chocolate x from a_x to 2^k - a_x (that is, perform a_x := 2^k - a_x). The chocolate exchanges will be stopped only when a_x = a_y. Note that other pairs of equal chocolate types do not stop the procedure. Icy's grandparents are smart, so they would choose the sequence of chocolate exchanges that minimizes the number of exchanges needed. Since Icy likes causing trouble, she wants to maximize the minimum number of exchanges needed by choosing x and y appropriately.

The box contains n chocolates. The i-th chocolate has a non-negative integer type a_i. Icy believes that good things come in pairs. Unfortunately, all types of chocolates are distinct (all a_i are distinct). Icy wants to make at least one pair of chocolates the same type. As a result, she asks her grandparents to perform some chocolate exchanges. Before performing any chocolate exchanges, Icy chooses two chocolates with indices x and y (1 ≤ x, y ≤ n, x ≠ y). In a chocolate exchange, Icy's grandparents choose a non-negative integer k, such that 2^k ≥ a_x, and change the type of the chocolate x from a_x to 2^k - a_x (that is, perform a_x := 2^k - a_x). The chocolate exchanges will be stopped only when a_x = a_y. Note that other pairs of equal chocolate types do not stop the procedure. Icy's grandparents are smart, so they would choose the sequence of chocolate exchanges that minimizes the number of exchanges needed. Since Icy likes causing trouble, she wants to maximize the minimum number of exchanges needed by choosing x and y appropriately. She wonders what is the optimal pair (x, y) such that the minimum number of exchanges needed is maximized across all possible choices of (x, y). Input The first line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) — the number of chocolates. The second line of the input contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). It is guaranteed that all a_i are distinct. Output Output three integers x, y, and m. x and y are indices of the optimal chocolates to perform exchanges on. Your output must satisfy 1 ≤ x, y ≤ n, x ≠ y. m is the number of exchanges needed to obtain a_x = a_y. We can show that m ≤ 10^9 for any pair of chocolates.

Each node has a string label, initially is a single character c_u. Let's define the string representation of the binary tree as the concatenation of the labels of the nodes in the in-order.

And if there is a horizontal wall (the upper or lower walls), dr is reflected before the movement, so the new value of dr is -dr. Each second (including the moment before the robot starts moving), the robot cleans every cell lying in the same row or the same column as its position. There is only one dirty cell at (r_d, c_d). The job of the robot is to clean that dirty cell. Input Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). Description of the test cases follows. A test case consists of only one line, containing six integers n, m, r_b, c_b, r_d, and c_d (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100, 1 ≤ r_b, r_d ≤ n, 1 ≤ c_b, c_d ≤ m) — the sizes of the room, the initial position of the robot and the position of the dirt cell. Output For each test case, print an integer — the time for the robot to clean the dirty cell. We can show that the robot always cleans the dirty cell eventually.\n\nExample Input 5 10 10 6 1 2 8 10 10 9 9 1 1 9 8 5 6 2 1 6 9 2 2 5 8 2 2 1 1 2 1 Output 7 10 9 3 0 Note In the first example, the floor has the size of 10× 10.

There are n cities in Omkarland, and, rather curiously, there are exactly n-1 bidirectional roads connecting the cities to each other. It is guaranteed that you can reach any city from any other city through the road network. Every city has an enjoyment value e. Each road has a capacity c, denoting the maximum number of vehicles that can be on it, and an associated toll t. However, the toll system in Omkarland has an interesting quirk: if a vehicle travels on multiple roads on a single journey, they pay only the highest toll of any single road on which they traveled. (In other words, they pay max t over all the roads on which they traveled.) If a vehicle traverses no roads, they pay 0 toll. Omkar has decided to host q tour groups. Each tour group consists of v vehicles starting at city x. (Keep in mind that a tour group with v vehicles can travel only on roads with capacity ≥ v.) Being the tour organizer, Omkar wants his groups to have as much fun as they possibly can, but also must reimburse his groups for the tolls that they have to pay. Thus, for each tour group, Omkar wants to know two things: first, what is the enjoyment value of the city y with maximum enjoyment value that the tour group can reach from their starting city, and second, how much per vehicle will Omkar have to pay to reimburse the entire group for their trip from x to y?

There are n cities in Omkarland, and, rather curiously, there are exactly n-1 bidirectional roads connecting the cities to each other. It is guaranteed that you can reach any city from any other city through the road network. Every city has an enjoyment value e. Each road has a capacity c, denoting the maximum number of vehicles that can be on it, and an associated toll t. However, the toll system in Omkarland has an interesting quirk: if a vehicle travels on multiple roads on a single journey, they pay only the highest toll of any single road on which they traveled. (In other words, they pay max t over all the roads on which they traveled.) If a vehicle traverses no roads, they pay 0 toll. Omkar has decided to host q tour groups. Each tour group consists of v vehicles starting at city x. (Keep in mind that a tour group with v vehicles can travel only on roads with capacity ≥ v.) Being the tour organizer, Omkar wants his groups to have as much fun as they possibly can, but also must reimburse his groups for the tolls that they have to pay. Thus, for each tour group, Omkar wants to know two things: first, what is the enjoyment value of the city y with maximum enjoyment value that the tour group can reach from their starting city, and second, how much per vehicle will Omkar have to pay to reimburse the entire group for their trip from x to y? (This trip from x to y will always be on the shortest path from x to y.) In the case that there are multiple reachable cities with the maximum enjoyment value, Omkar will let his tour group choose which one they want to go to.

In this game, his character has to kill a dragon. The battle with the dragon lasts 100^{500} seconds, during which Monocarp attacks the dragon with a poisoned dagger. The i-th attack is performed at the beginning of the a_i-th second from the battle start. The dagger itself does not deal damage, but it applies a poison effect on the dragon, which deals 1 damage during each of the next k seconds (starting with the same second when the dragon was stabbed by the dagger). However, if the dragon has already been poisoned, then the dagger updates the poison effect (i.e. cancels the current poison effect and applies a new one). For example, suppose k = 4, and Monocarp stabs the dragon during the seconds 2, 4 and 10. Then the poison effect is applied at the start of the 2-nd second and deals 1 damage during the 2-nd and 3-rd seconds; then, at the beginning of the 4-th second, the poison effect is reapplied, so it deals exactly 1 damage during the seconds 4, 5, 6 and 7; then, during the 10-th second, the poison effect is applied again, and it deals 1 damage during the seconds 10, 11, 12 and 13. In total, the dragon receives 10 damage. Monocarp knows that the dragon has h hit points, and if he deals at least h damage to the dragon during the battle — he slays the dragon.

Blue can do the following operation any number of times:\n  * Pick any subtree of the rooted tree, and color every node in the subtree blue.

After the two turns, the score of the game is determined as follows: let w be the number of white nodes, r be the number of red nodes, and b be the number of blue nodes.
