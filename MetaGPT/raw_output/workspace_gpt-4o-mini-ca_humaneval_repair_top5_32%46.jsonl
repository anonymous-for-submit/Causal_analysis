Specify the `key` parameter as the `digits_sum` function to sort based on the sum of digits. This ensures that if two numbers have the same digit sum, they are ordered by their original index.\n\n   ```python\n       return sorted(nums, key=digits_sum)\n   ```\n\nBy following these steps, developers can create a function that meets the requirement of ordering integers based on the sum of their digits while maintaining the original order for ties.", "File list": ["main.py"], "Data structures and interfaces": "def order_by_points(nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    \"\"\" Sorts a list of integers based on the sum of their digits.\n\n    Args:\n        nums (List[int]): A list of integers to be sorted.\n\n    Returns:\n        List[int]: A new list of integers sorted by the sum of their digits, maintaining original order for ties.\n    \"\"\"", "Program call flow": "sequenceDiagram\n    participant User\n    participant Function\n    User->>Function: order_by_points([1, 11, -1, -11, -12])\n    Function->>Function: Calculate digit sum for each number\n    Function->>Function: Sort numbers based on digit sum and original index\n    Function-->>User: return [-1, -11, 1, -12, 11]\n    User->>Function: order_by_points([])\n    Function-->>User: return []", "Anything UNCLEAR": "Clarification needed on whether the function should handle non-integer inputs or if it should strictly accept integers."}, "task": {"Required packages": ["typing.List"], "Required Other language third-party packages": ["No third-party dependencies required"], "Logic Analysis": [["main.py", "Contains one function with the same input/output format as user requirement"]], "File list": ["main.py"], "Full API spec": "", "Shared Knowledge": "", "Anything UNCLEAR": "Clarification needed on whether the function should handle non-integer inputs or if it should strictly accept integers."}, "eval_result": true}

Set `begin` to -1.0 and `end` to 1.0. This establishes an initial interval where the polynomial potentially has a root.\n   ```python\n   begin, end = -1., 1.\n   ```\n\n2. **Expand Search Interval:** Implement a loop to expand the interval by multiplying both `begin` and `end` by 2.0 until the product of the polynomial evaluations at these points is negative. This ensures that there is at least one root in the interval.\n   ```python\n   while poly(xs, begin) * poly(xs, end) > 0:\n       begin *= 2.0\n       end *= 2.0\n   ```\n\n3. **Narrow Down the Interval:** Use a while loop to repeatedly narrow the interval until the difference between `end` and `begin` is less than a small threshold (1e-10). This ensures the solution is precise.\n   ```python\n   while end - begin > 1e-10:\n   ```\n\n4. **Calculate Midpoint:** Within the narrowing loop, calculate the midpoint `center` as the average of `begin` and `end`. This midpoint will be used to test where the root lies.\n   ```python\n   center = (begin + end) / 2.0\n   ```\n\n5. **Evaluate Polynomial at Midpoint:** Check the sign of the polynomial evaluated at `center` compared to the polynomial evaluated at `begin`. If they have the same sign, move `begin` to `center`, otherwise move `end` to `center`. This narrows down the interval towards the root.\n   ```python\n   if poly(xs, center) * poly(xs, begin) > 0:\n       begin = center\n   else:\n       end = center\n   ```\n\n6. **Return the Root:** Once the interval has been sufficiently narrowed, return `begin` which now approximates the root of the polynomial.\n   ```python\n   return begin\n   ```", "File list": ["main.py"], "Data structures and interfaces": "1.
