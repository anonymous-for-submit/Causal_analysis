In one second, you can either remove two adjacent Lego pieces from the strip (if both are present), or add two Lego pieces to adjacent positions (if both are absent). You can only add or remove Lego's at two adjacent positions at the same time, as otherwise your chubby fingers run into precision issues. You want to know exactly how much time you'll spend playing with Legos. You value efficiency, so given some starting state and some ending state, you'll always spend the least number of seconds to transform the starting state into the ending state.

The issue is that, for some positions, you don't remember whether there were Legos there or not (in either the starting state, the ending state, or both).

Let us consider an empty [deque](https://tinyurl.com/pfeucbux) (double-ended queue). A deque is a data structure that supports adding elements to both the beginning and the end. So, if there are elements [3, 4, 4] currently in the deque, adding an element 1 to the beginning will produce the sequence [\u001b[38;5;1m1\u001b[0m, 3, 4, 4], and adding the same element to the end will produce [3, 4, 4, \u001b[38;5;1m1\u001b[0m]. The elements of the array are sequentially added to the initially empty deque, starting with a_1 and finishing with a_n. Before adding each element to the deque, you may choose whether to add it to the beginning or to the end. Find the minimal possible number of inversions in the deque after the whole array is processed. An inversion in sequence d is a pair of indices (i, j) such that i < j and d_i > d_j. For example, the array d = [5, 3, 7, 5] has exactly two inversions — (1, 2) and (3, 4), since d_1 = 5 > 3 = d_2 and d_3 = 7 > 5 = d_4.\n\nInput The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) — the number of test cases.

So, if there are elements [3, 4, 4] currently in the deque, adding an element 1 to the beginning will produce the sequence [\u001b[38;5;1m1\u001b[0m, 3, 4, 4], and adding the same element to the end will produce [3, 4, 4, \u001b[38;5;1m1\u001b[0m].

Before adding each element to the deque, you may choose whether to add it to the beginning or to the end. Find the minimal possible number of inversions in the deque after the whole array is processed. An inversion in sequence d is a pair of indices (i, j) such that i < j and d_i > d_j. For example, the array d = [5, 3, 7, 5] has exactly two inversions — (1, 2) and (3, 4), since d_1 = 5 > 3 = d_2 and d_3 = 7 > 5 = d_4.\n\nInput The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) — the number of test cases.

The i-th of the following n lines contains three integers x_i, y_i, c_i (|x_i|,|y_i| ≤ 10^9; 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 3), where (x_i, y_i) are the coordinates of the i-th marked cell and c_i is its color. It's guaranteed that all cells (x_i, y_i) in the input are distinct, and that there are exactly n/3 cells of each color. Output Output a single integer k — the largest number of cells you can leave.

You can perform the following operation with x: write it in its binary form without leading zeros, add 0 or 1 to the right of it, reverse the binary form and turn it into a decimal number which is assigned as the new value of x. For example: * 34 can be turned into 81 via one operation: the binary form of 34 is 100010, if you add 1, reverse it and remove leading zeros, you will get 1010001, which is the binary form of 81. * 34 can be turned into 17 via one operation: the binary form of 34 is 100010, if you add 0, reverse it and remove leading zeros, you will get 10001, which is the binary form of 17. * 81 can be turned into 69 via one operation: the binary form of 81 is 1010001, if you add 0, reverse it and remove leading zeros, you will get 1000101, which is the binary form of 69. * 34 can be turned into 69 via two operations: first you turn 34 into 81 and then 81 into 69. Your task is to find out whether x can be turned into y after a certain number of operations (possibly zero). Input The only line of the input contains two integers x and y (1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^{18}). Output Print YES if you can make x equal to y and NO if you can't. Examples Input 3 3 Output YES Input 7 4 Output NO Input 2 8 Output NO Input 34 69 Output YES Input 8935891487501725 71487131900013807 Output YES Note In the first example, you don't even need to do anything.

No two two-way railways connect the same two stations. Besides, it is possible to travel from any station to any other using those railways. Among these n stations, station 1 is the main station. You can get to any station from any other station using only two-way railways. Because of the technological limitation, Nitori can only construct one-way railways, whose length can be arbitrary positive integer. Constructing a one-way railway from station u will costs w_u units of resources, no matter where the railway ends. To ease the congestion, Nitori plans that after construction there are at least two shortest paths from station 1 to any other station, and these two shortest paths do not pass the same station except station 1 and the terminal. Besides, Nitori also does not want to change the distance of the shortest path from station 1 to any other station. Due to various reasons, sometimes the cost of building a new railway will increase uncontrollably. There will be a total of q occurrences of this kind of incident, and the i-th event will add additional amount of x_i to the cost of building a new railway from the station k_i.

No two two-way railways connect the same two stations. Besides, it is possible to travel from any station to any other using those railways. Among these n stations, station 1 is the main station.

Constructing a one-way railway from station u will costs w_u units of resources, no matter where the railway ends. To ease the congestion, Nitori plans that after construction there are at least two shortest paths from station 1 to any other station, and these two shortest paths do not pass the same station except station 1 and the terminal.

As a result, we get an explosion on the field in the form of a \"plus\" symbol ('+'). Thus, one explosion can cause new explosions, and so on.
