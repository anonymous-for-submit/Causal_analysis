Formally, the square of the Euclidean distance between two points (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2) is (x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2. To optimize the building plan, the project supervisor asks you the sum of all S(x, y) for each 0 ≤ x ≤ n and 0 ≤ y ≤ m. Input The first line contains two integers n and m (0 ≤ n, m < 2000) — the size of the grid. Then (n + 1) lines follow, each containing (m + 1) integers a_{i, j} (0 ≤ a_{i, j} ≤ 1) — the grid denoting the positions of telephone poles in the plane. There is at least one telephone pole in the given grid.

The robot can start its movement in any cell. He then moves to the adjacent square in the direction indicated on the current square in one move. If the robot moves beyond the edge of the board, it falls and breaks. If the robot appears in the cell it already visited before, it breaks (it stops and doesn't move anymore).

Each cell has one of the symbols 'L', 'R', 'D' or 'U' written on it, indicating the direction in which the robot will move when it gets in that cell — left, right, down or up, respectively. The robot can start its movement in any cell. He then moves to the adjacent square in the direction indicated on the current square in one move. If the robot moves beyond the edge of the board, it falls and breaks. If the robot appears in the cell it already visited before, it breaks (it stops and doesn't move anymore). Robot can choose any cell as the starting cell. Its goal is to make the maximum number of steps before it breaks or stops. Determine from which square the robot should start its movement in order to execute as many commands as possible. A command is considered successfully completed if the robot has moved from the square on which that command was written (it does not matter whether to another square or beyond the edge of the board). Input The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10000) — the number of test cases in the test. Each test case's description is preceded by a blank line. Next is a line that contains integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000; 1 ≤ m ≤ 2000) — the height and width of the board. This line followed by n lines, the i-th of which describes the i-th line of the board. Each of them is exactly m letters long and consists of symbols 'L', 'R', 'D' and 'U'. It is guaranteed that the sum of sizes of all boards in the input does not exceed 4⋅10^6. Output For each test case, output three integers r, c and d (1 ≤ r ≤ n; 1 ≤ c ≤ m; d ≥ 0), which denote that the robot should start moving from cell (r, c) to make the maximum number of moves d.

The robot can start its movement in any cell. He then moves to the adjacent square in the direction indicated on the current square in one move. If the robot moves beyond the edge of the board, it falls and breaks. If the robot appears in the cell it already visited before, it breaks (it stops and doesn't move anymore). Robot can choose any cell as the starting cell. Its goal is to make the maximum number of steps before it breaks or stops. Determine from which square the robot should start its movement in order to execute as many commands as possible. A command is considered successfully completed if the robot has moved from the square on which that command was written (it does not matter whether to another square or beyond the edge of the board). Input The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10000) — the number of test cases in the test. Each test case's description is preceded by a blank line. Next is a line that contains integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000; 1 ≤ m ≤ 2000) — the height and width of the board. This line followed by n lines, the i-th of which describes the i-th line of the board. Each of them is exactly m letters long and consists of symbols 'L', 'R', 'D' and 'U'. It is guaranteed that the sum of sizes of all boards in the input does not exceed 4⋅10^6. Output For each test case, output three integers r, c and d (1 ≤ r ≤ n; 1 ≤ c ≤ m; d ≥ 0), which denote that the robot should start moving from cell (r, c) to make the maximum number of moves d. If there are several answers, output any of them.\n\nExample Input 7 1 1 R 1 3 RRL 2 2 DL RU 2 2 UD RU 3 2 DL UL RU 4 4 RRRD RUUD URUD ULLR 4 4 DDLU RDDU UUUU RDLD Output 1 1 1 1 1 3 1 1 4 2 1 3 3 1 5 4 3 12 1 1 4"}, "task": {"Required packages": ["No required packages"], "Required Other language third-party packages": ["No third-party dependencies required"], "Logic Analysis": [["main.py", "Contains one function with the same input/output format as user requirement"]], "File list": ["main.py"], "Full API spec": "", "Shared Knowledge": "", "Anything UNCLEAR": "Clarification needed on whether the function should handle only integers or also floating-point numbers."}, "eval_result": true}

To go from the x-th room to the y-th room, there must exist a tunnel between x and y, and it takes max(|a_x + a_y|, |a_x - a_y|) energy. |z| denotes the absolute value of z. To prevent grave robbers, the maze can change the illusion rate of any room in it. Chanek and Indiana would ask q queries. There are two types of queries to be done:\n\n  * 1\\ u\\ c — The illusion rate of the x-th room is changed to c (1 ≤ u ≤ n, 0 ≤ |c| ≤ 10^9). \n  * 2\\ u\\ v — Chanek and Indiana ask you the minimum sum of energy needed to take the secret treasure at room v if they are initially at room u (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n).\n\nInput The first line contains two integers n and q (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ q ≤ 10^5) — the number of rooms in the maze and the number of queries. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (0 ≤ |a_i| ≤ 10^9) — inital illusion rate of each room. The i-th of the next n-1 lines contains two integers s_i and t_i (1 ≤ s_i, t_i ≤ n), meaning there is a tunnel connecting s_i-th room and t_i-th room. The given edges form a tree. The next q lines contain the query as described. The given queries are valid.\n\nOutput For each type 2 query, output a line containing an integer — the minimum sum of energy needed for Chanek and Indiana to take the secret treasure."}, "task": {"Required packages": ["No required packages"], "Required Other language third-party packages": ["No third-party dependencies required"], "Logic Analysis": [["main.py", "Contains functions to initialize the maze, update illusion rates, and calculate minimum energy for a given path."]], "File list": ["main.py"], "Full API spec": "", "Shared Knowledge": "", "Anything UNCLEAR": "Clarification needed on how to start and initialize third-party libraries."}, "eval_result": true}

Each cell has one of the symbols 'L', 'R', 'D' or 'U' written on it, indicating the direction in which the robot will move when it gets in that cell — left, right, down or up, respectively. The robot can start its movement in any cell. He then moves to the adjacent square in the direction indicated on the current square in one move. If the robot moves beyond the edge of the board, it falls and breaks. If the robot appears in the cell it already visited before, it breaks (it stops and doesn't move anymore). Robot can choose any cell as the starting cell. Its goal is to make the maximum number of steps before it breaks or stops. Determine from which square the robot should start its movement in order to execute as many commands as possible. A command is considered successfully completed if the robot has moved from the square on which that command was written (it does not matter whether to another square or beyond the edge of the board). Input The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10000) — the number of test cases in the test. Each test case's description is preceded by a blank line. Next is a line that contains integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000; 1 ≤ m ≤ 2000) — the height and width of the board. This line followed by n lines, the i-th of which describes the i-th line of the board. Each of them is exactly m letters long and consists of symbols 'L', 'R', 'D' and 'U'. It is guaranteed that the sum of sizes of all boards in the input does not exceed 4⋅10^6. Output For each test case, output three integers r, c and d (1 ≤ r ≤ n; 1 ≤ c ≤ m; d ≥ 0), which denote that the robot should start moving from cell (r, c) to make the maximum number of moves d. If there are several answers, output any of them.\n\nExample Input 7 1 1 R 1 3 RRL 2 2 DL RU 2 2 UD RU 3 2 DL UL RU 4 4 RRRD RUUD URUD ULLR 4 4 DDLU RDDU UUUU RDLD Output 1 1 1 1 1 3 1 1 4 2 1 3 3 1 5 4 3 12 1 1 4"}, "task": {"Required packages": ["No required packages"], "Required Other language third-party packages": ["No third-party dependencies required"], "Logic Analysis": [["main.py", "Contains one function with the same input/output format as user requirement"]], "File list": ["main.py"], "Full API spec": "openapi: 3.0.0 ...", "Shared Knowledge": "", "Anything UNCLEAR": "Clarification needed on how to start and initialize third-party libraries."}, "eval_result": true}

The rows in the board are numbered from 1 to n from top to bottom, and the columns — from 1 to m from left to left. The robot is able to move from the current cell to one of the four cells adjacent by side. Each cell has one of the symbols 'L', 'R', 'D' or 'U' written on it, indicating the direction in which the robot will move when it gets in that cell — left, right, down or up, respectively. The robot can start its movement in any cell. He then moves to the adjacent square in the direction indicated on the current square in one move. If the robot moves beyond the edge of the board, it falls and breaks. If the robot appears in the cell it already visited before, it breaks (it stops and doesn't move anymore).

If the robot moves beyond the edge of the board, it falls and breaks. If the robot appears in the cell it already visited before, it breaks (it stops and doesn't move anymore). Robot can choose any cell as the starting cell. Its goal is to make the maximum number of steps before it breaks or stops. Determine from which square the robot should start its movement in order to execute as many commands as possible. A command is considered successfully completed if the robot has moved from the square on which that command was written (it does not matter whether to another square or beyond the edge of the board). Input The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10000) — the number of test cases in the test. Each test case's description is preceded by a blank line. Next is a line that contains integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000; 1 ≤ m ≤ 2000) — the height and width of the board. This line followed by n lines, the i-th of which describes the i-th line of the board. Each of them is exactly m letters long and consists of symbols 'L', 'R', 'D' and 'U'. It is guaranteed that the sum of sizes of all boards in the input does not exceed 4⋅10^6. Output For each test case, output three integers r, c and d (1 ≤ r ≤ n; 1 ≤ c ≤ m; d ≥ 0), which denote that the robot should start moving from cell (r, c) to make the maximum number of moves d.
