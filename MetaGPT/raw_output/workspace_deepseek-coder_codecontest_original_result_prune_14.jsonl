Instead, it allows you to cut out any segment of the given array, cyclically shift (rotate) it by any offset and insert it back into the same place. \n\nTechnically, each cyclic shift consists of two consecutive actions: \n\n  1. You may select arbitrary indices l and r (1 ≤ l < r ≤ n) as the boundaries of the segment. \n  2. Then you replace the segment a[l … r] with it's cyclic shift to the left by an arbitrary offset d. The concept of a cyclic shift can be also explained by following relations: the sequence [1, 4, 1, 3] is a cyclic shift of the sequence [3, 1, 4, 1] to the left by the offset 1 and the sequence [4, 1, 3, 1] is a cyclic shift of the sequence [3, 1, 4, 1] to the left by the offset 2. \n\nFor example, if a = [1, \\color{blue}{3, 2, 8}, 5], then choosing l = 2, r = 4 and d = 2 yields a segment a[2 … 4] = [3, 2, 8].

Instead, it allows you to cut out any segment of the given array, cyclically shift (rotate) it by any offset and insert it back into the same place. \n\nTechnically, each cyclic shift consists of two consecutive actions: \n\n  1. You may select arbitrary indices l and r (1 ≤ l < r ≤ n) as the boundaries of the segment. \n  2. Then you replace the segment a[l … r] with it's cyclic shift to the left by an arbitrary offset d. The concept of a cyclic shift can be also explained by following relations: the sequence [1, 4, 1, 3] is a cyclic shift of the sequence [3, 1, 4, 1] to the left by the offset 1 and the sequence [4, 1, 3, 1] is a cyclic shift of the sequence [3, 1, 4, 1] to the left by the offset 2. \n\nFor example, if a = [1, \\color{blue}{3, 2, 8}, 5], then choosing l = 2, r = 4 and d = 2 yields a segment a[2 … 4] = [3, 2, 8]. This segment is then shifted by the offset d = 2 to the left, and you get a segment [8, 3, 2] which then takes the place of of the original elements of the segment. In the end you get a = [1, \\color{blue}{8, 3, 2}, 5].\n\nSort the given array a using no more than n cyclic shifts of any of its segments.

The i-th song had its predicted rating equal to p_i, where 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n and every integer from 1 to n appears exactly once. In other words, p is a permutation. After listening to each of them, Monocarp pressed either a like or a dislike button. Let his vote sequence be represented with a string s, such that s_i=0 means that he disliked the i-th song, and s_i=1 means that he liked it. Now the service has to re-evaluate the song ratings in such a way that: the new ratings q_1, q_2, ..., q_n still form a permutation (1 ≤ q_i ≤ n; each integer from 1 to n appears exactly once); every song that Monocarp liked should have a greater rating than every song that Monocarp disliked (formally, for all i, j such that s_i=1 and s_j=0, q_i>q_j should hold).

They want to play the Hat k times. Thus, k games will be played at each table. Each player will play in k games. To do this, they are distributed among the tables for each game. During each game, one player plays at exactly one table. A player can play at different tables. Players want to have the most \"fair\" schedule of games. For this reason, they are looking for a schedule (table distribution for each game) such that: At any table in each game there are either ⌊n/m⌋ people or ⌈n/m⌉ people (that is, either n/m rounded down, or n/m rounded up).

If v = -1: Santa doesn't remember what the set of lights were on for this edge. v ≥ 0: The set of lights on the edge is v. The next m lines of each test case each contains three integers, a, b, and p (1 ≤ a, b ≤ n; a ≠ b; 0 ≤ p ≤ 1) — the nodes that the elf was assigned to, and the parity of the number of set bits in the elf's favorite number. It is guaranteed that the sum of all n and the sum of all m don't exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5 each. It is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree. Output For each test case, first print either YES or NO (in any case), whether there's a tree consistent with Santa's memory or not. If the answer is YES, print n-1 lines each containing three integers: x, y, and v (1 ≤ x, y ≤ n; 0 ≤ v < 2^{30}) — the edge and the integer on that edge. The set of edges must be the same as in the input, and if the value of some edge was specified earlier, it can not change. You can print the edges in any order. If there are multiple answers, print any.\n\nExample Input 4 6 5 1 2 -1 1 3 1 4 2 7 6 3 0 2 5 -1 2 3 1 2 5 0 5 6 1 6 1 1 4 5 1 5 3 1 2 -1 1 3 -1 1 4 1 4 5 -1 2 4 0 3 4 1 2 3 0 2 1 1 2 0 Output YES 1 2 0 1 3 1 2 4 7 3 6 0 2 5 0 YES 1 2 1 1 3 0 1 4 1 4 5 1 NO NO"}, "task": {"Required packages": ["No required packages"], "Required Other language third-party packages": [], "Logic Analysis": [], "File list": ["main.py"], "Full API spec": "", "Shared Knowledge": "", "Anything UNCLEAR": ""}, "eval_result": true}

So, for each k (0 ≤ k ≤ n - m + 1), find the minimum number of elements in a that have to be changed such that there are exactly k occurrences of b in a. A string s occurs exactly k times in t if there are exactly k different pairs (p,q) such that we can obtain s by deleting p characters from the beginning and q characters from the end of t.

In this game, his character has to kill a dragon. The battle with the dragon lasts 100^{500} seconds, during which Monocarp attacks the dragon with a poisoned dagger. The i-th attack is performed at the beginning of the a_i-th second from the battle start. The dagger itself does not deal damage, but it applies a poison effect on the dragon, which deals 1 damage during each of the next k seconds (starting with the same second when the dragon was stabbed by the dagger). However, if the dragon has already been poisoned, then the dagger updates the poison effect (i.e. cancels the current poison effect and applies a new one). For example, suppose k = 4, and Monocarp stabs the dragon during the seconds 2, 4 and 10. Then the poison effect is applied at the start of the 2-nd second and deals 1 damage during the 2-nd and 3-rd seconds; then, at the beginning of the 4-th second, the poison effect is reapplied, so it deals exactly 1 damage during the seconds 4, 5, 6 and 7; then, during the 10-th second, the poison effect is applied again, and it deals 1 damage during the seconds 10, 11, 12 and 13. In total, the dragon receives 10 damage. Monocarp knows that the dragon has h hit points, and if he deals at least h damage to the dragon during the battle — he slays the dragon.
