During this process, the machine can take the same index multiple times in different steps. \n\nBob was very excited about the gift that his friends gave him, so he put his favorite array in the machine. However, when the machine finished, Bob was not happy with the resulting array. He misses his favorite array very much, and hopes to get it back. \n\nGiven the array that the machine outputted, help Bob find an array that could be the original array that he put in the machine. Sometimes the machine makes mistakes, so it is possible that no appropriate input array exists for the array it has outputted. In such case, let Bob know that his array is forever lost.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains one positive integer N (2 ≤ N ≤ 10^3) – the length of Bob's array.\n\nThe second line contains N integers B_1, B_2, ..., B_N (1 ≤ B_i ≤ 10^6) – the elements of the array the machine outputted.\n\nOutput\n\nIf an appropriate input array exists, print \"YES\", followed by the input array A_1, A_2, ..., A_N (-10^9 ≤ A_i ≤ 10^9) in the next line. Otherwise, print \"NO\".\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n2\n5 5\n\nOutput\n\nYES\n2 3\n\nInput\n\n3\n1 2 3\n\nOutput\n\nYES\n0 1 2\n\nInput\n\n3\n2 4 5\n\nOutput\n\nNO\n\nInput\n\n4\n1 3 5 7\n\nOutput\n\nYES\n6 -3 4 1\n"}, "task": {"Required packages": ["No required packages"], "Required Other language third-party packages": [], "Logic Analysis": [["main.py", "Contains one function with the same input/output format as user requirement"]], "File list": ["main.py"], "Full API spec": "", "Shared Knowledge": "", "Anything UNCLEAR": ""}, "eval_result": true}

In other words, if Gorf is on x meters below ground level, then in one jump he can go up on any integer distance from 0 to a_x meters inclusive. (Note that Gorf can't jump down, only up). Unfortunately, Gorf has to take a break after each jump (including jump on 0 meters). And after jumping up to position x meters below ground level, he'll slip exactly b_x meters down while resting.

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, …, b_n (0 ≤ b_i ≤ n - i), where b_i is the distance Gorf will slip down if he takes a break on i meters below ground level.

The vertex 1 is the root. You are to answer some questions about the tree. A tree is a connected graph without cycles. A rooted tree has a special vertex called the root. The parent of a node v is the next vertex on the shortest path from v to the root. Each question is defined by three integers v, l, and k. To get the answer to the question, you need to perform the following steps: First, write down the sequence of all integers written on the shortest path from the vertex v to the root (including those written in the v and the root). Count the number of times each integer occurs. Remove all integers with less than l occurrences. Replace the sequence, removing all duplicates and ordering the elements by the number of occurrences in the original list in increasing order. In case of a tie, you can choose the order of these elements arbitrary. The answer to the question is the k-th number in the remaining sequence. Note that the answer is not always uniquely determined, because there could be several orderings. Also, it is possible that the length of the sequence on this step is less than k, in this case the answer is -1. For example, if the sequence of integers on the path from v to the root is [2, 2, 1, 7, 1, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4], l = 2 and k = 2, then the answer is 1. Please answer all questions about the tree.

The vertex 1 is the root. You are to answer some questions about the tree. A tree is a connected graph without cycles. A rooted tree has a special vertex called the root. The parent of a node v is the next vertex on the shortest path from v to the root. Each question is defined by three integers v, l, and k. To get the answer to the question, you need to perform the following steps: First, write down the sequence of all integers written on the shortest path from the vertex v to the root (including those written in the v and the root). Count the number of times each integer occurs. Remove all integers with less than l occurrences. Replace the sequence, removing all duplicates and ordering the elements by the number of occurrences in the original list in increasing order. In case of a tie, you can choose the order of these elements arbitrary. The answer to the question is the k-th number in the remaining sequence. Note that the answer is not always uniquely determined, because there could be several orderings. Also, it is possible that the length of the sequence on this step is less than k, in this case the answer is -1. For example, if the sequence of integers on the path from v to the root is [2, 2, 1, 7, 1, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4], l = 2 and k = 2, then the answer is 1. Please answer all questions about the tree.

It is guaranteed that it is possible to eat m grams of food from each dish. In other words, m ≤ a_i+b_i for all i from 1 to n inclusive. Output For each test case, print on the first line the minimal balance value that can be achieved by eating exactly m grams of food from each dish. Then print n lines that describe a way to do this: the i-th line should contain two integers x_i and y_i (0 ≤ x_i ≤ a_i; 0 ≤ y_i ≤ b_i; x_i+y_i=m), where x_i is how many grams of fish taster should eat from the i-th meal and y_i is how many grams of meat.

Below you can find an example of the 4 × 9 box, with two ticks of sizes 2 and 3. <image> You are given a description of a checkered field of size n × m. Casimir claims that this field came about after he drew some (possibly 0) ticks on it. The ticks could be of different sizes, but the size of each tick is at least k (that is, d ≥ k for all the ticks). Determine whether this field can indeed be obtained by drawing some (possibly none) ticks of sizes d ≥ k or not. Input The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) — the number test cases. The following lines contain the descriptions of the test cases. The first line of the test case description contains the integers n, m, and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10; 1 ≤ m ≤ 19) — the field size and the minimum size of the ticks that Casimir drew. The following n lines describe the field: each line consists of m characters either being '.' if the corresponding cell is not yet painted or '*' otherwise. Output Print t lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to a test case should be YES if the given field can be obtained by drawing ticks of at least the given size and NO otherwise. You may print every letter in any case you want (so, for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive answers)."}, "task": {"Required packages": ["No required packages"], "Required Other language third-party packages": [], "Logic Analysis": [["main.py", "Contains one function with the same input/output format as user requirement"]], "File list": ["main.py"], "Full API spec": "openapi: 3.0.0 ...", "Shared Knowledge": "", "Anything UNCLEAR": "Clarification needed on how to start and initialize third-party libraries."}, "eval_result": true}

There are n nodes in the tree, connected by n-1 edges. On each edge of the tree, there's a set of Christmas lights, which can be represented by an integer in binary representation. He has m elves come over and admire his tree. Each elf is assigned two nodes, a and b, and that elf looks at all lights on the simple path between the two nodes. After this, the elf's favorite number becomes the [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) of the values of the lights on the edges in that path. However, the North Pole has been recovering from a nasty bout of flu. Because of this, Santa forgot some of the configurations of lights he had put on the tree, and he has already left the North Pole! Fortunately, the elves came to the rescue, and each one told Santa what pair of nodes he was assigned (a_i, b_i), as well as the parity of the number of set bits in his favorite number. In other words, he remembers whether the number of 1's when his favorite number is written in binary is odd or even. Help Santa determine if it's possible that the memories are consistent, and if it is, remember what his tree looked like, and maybe you'll go down in history!\n\nInput The first line contains one integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4) — the number of test cases. Then t cases follow. The first line of each test case contains two integers, n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; 1 ≤ m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) — the size of tree and the number of elves respectively. The next n-1 lines of each test case each contains three integers, x, y, and v (1 ≤ x, y ≤ n; -1 ≤ v < 2^{30}) — meaning that there's an edge between nodes x and y. If v = -1: Santa doesn't remember what the set of lights were on for this edge. v ≥ 0: The set of lights on the edge is v. The next m lines of each test case each contains three integers, a, b, and p (1 ≤ a, b ≤ n; a ≠ b; 0 ≤ p ≤ 1) — the nodes that the elf was assigned to, and the parity of the number of set bits in the elf's favorite number. It is guaranteed that the sum of all n and the sum of all m don't exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5 each. It is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree. Output For each test case, first print either YES or NO (in any case), whether there's a tree consistent with Santa's memory or not.

He has m elves come over and admire his tree. Each elf is assigned two nodes, a and b, and that elf looks at all lights on the simple path between the two nodes. After this, the elf's favorite number becomes the [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) of the values of the lights on the edges in that path. However, the North Pole has been recovering from a nasty bout of flu. Because of this, Santa forgot some of the configurations of lights he had put on the tree, and he has already left the North Pole! Fortunately, the elves came to the rescue, and each one told Santa what pair of nodes he was assigned (a_i, b_i), as well as the parity of the number of set bits in his favorite number. In other words, he remembers whether the number of 1's when his favorite number is written in binary is odd or even. Help Santa determine if it's possible that the memories are consistent, and if it is, remember what his tree looked like, and maybe you'll go down in history!\n\nInput The first line contains one integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4) — the number of test cases. Then t cases follow. The first line of each test case contains two integers, n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; 1 ≤ m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) — the size of tree and the number of elves respectively. The next n-1 lines of each test case each contains three integers, x, y, and v (1 ≤ x, y ≤ n; -1 ≤ v < 2^{30}) — meaning that there's an edge between nodes x and y. If v = -1: Santa doesn't remember what the set of lights were on for this edge. v ≥ 0: The set of lights on the edge is v. The next m lines of each test case each contains three integers, a, b, and p (1 ≤ a, b ≤ n; a ≠ b; 0 ≤ p ≤ 1) — the nodes that the elf was assigned to, and the parity of the number of set bits in the elf's favorite number. It is guaranteed that the sum of all n and the sum of all m don't exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5 each. It is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree. Output For each test case, first print either YES or NO (in any case), whether there's a tree consistent with Santa's memory or not. If the answer is YES, print n-1 lines each containing three integers: x, y, and v (1 ≤ x, y ≤ n; 0 ≤ v < 2^{30}) — the edge and the integer on that edge.

Teucer wants to surprise his older brother with a map of Liyue. He also wants to know a valid coloring of edges that uses the minimum number of colors. Please help him with this task! Input The only line of input contains two integers n and k (2 ≤ k < n ≤ 1000). Output On the first line, output c, the minimum colors you need to satisfy the above requirements. On the second line, print a valid edge coloring as an array of (n(n-1))/(2) integers ranging from 1 to c. Exactly c distinct colors should exist in the construction. Print the edges in increasing order by the start node first, then by the second node."}, "task": {"Required packages": ["No required packages"], "Required Other language third-party packages": [], "Logic Analysis": [["main.py", "Contains one function with the same input/output format as user requirement"]], "File list": ["main.py"], "Full API spec": "", "Shared Knowledge": "", "Anything UNCLEAR": ""}, "eval_result": true}

You have a perfect binary tree of 2^k - 1 nodes — a binary tree where all vertices i from 1 to 2^{k - 1} - 1 have exactly two children: vertices 2i and 2i + 1. Vertices from 2^{k - 1} to 2^k - 1 don't have any children. You want to color its vertices with the 6 Rubik's cube colors (White, Green, Red, Blue, Orange and Yellow). Let's call a coloring good when all edges connect nodes with colors that are neighboring sides in the Rubik's cube. More formally: a white node can not be neighboring with white and yellow nodes; a yellow node can not be neighboring with white and yellow nodes; a green node can not be neighboring with green and blue nodes; a blue node can not be neighboring with green and blue nodes; a red node can not be neighboring with red and orange nodes; an orange node can not be neighboring with red and orange nodes.

Situations in which there are no elements of some color at all are also possible. For example, if the whole array is colored blue or red, one of the operations becomes unavailable. Determine whether it is possible to make 0 or more steps such that the resulting array is a permutation of numbers from 1 to n? In other words, check whether there exists a sequence of steps (possibly empty) such that after applying it, the array a contains in some order all numbers from 1 to n (inclusive), each exactly once. Input The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) — the number of input data sets in the test. The description of each set of input data consists of three lines. The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) — the length of the original array a. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (-10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) — the array elements themselves. The third line has length n and consists exclusively of the letters 'B' and/or 'R': ith character is 'B' if a_i is colored blue, and is 'R' if colored red.

To ease the congestion, Nitori plans that after construction there are at least two shortest paths from station 1 to any other station, and these two shortest paths do not pass the same station except station 1 and the terminal. Besides, Nitori also does not want to change the distance of the shortest path from station 1 to any other station. Due to various reasons, sometimes the cost of building a new railway will increase uncontrollably. There will be a total of q occurrences of this kind of incident, and the i-th of the next q lines contains two integers k_i,x_i (1 ≤ k_i ≤ n, 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 4 × 10^8). Output Print q+1 lines, and the i-th of these lines contains one integer, denoting the minimal cost of railway construction after the i-1-th incident (especially, the 0-th incident means no incident occurred)."}, "task": {"Required packages": ["No required packages"], "Required Other language third-party packages": [], "Logic Analysis": [["main.py", "Contains one function with the same input/output format as user requirement"]], "File list": ["main.py"], "Full API spec": "", "Shared Knowledge": "", "Anything UNCLEAR": ""}, "eval_result": true}

A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if and only if one of the following holds: * a is a prefix of b, but a ≠ b; * in the first position where a and b differ, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b. Now consider all different BA-strings and find the x-th lexicographically smallest of them. Input The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 2000) — the number of testcases. The first line of each testcase contains three integers n, k and x (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000; 0 ≤ k ≤ 2000; 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^18). n is the length of string s. The second line of each testcase is a string s.

For each testcase x doesn't exceed the total number of different BA-strings. String s contains at least one character 'a'. Output For each testcase, print a single string, consisting only of characters 'b' and 'a' (lowercase Latin letters) — the x-th lexicographically smallest BA-string.

Having nothing else to do he starts jumping between integer points on the axis. Making a jump from a point with coordinate x with a distance d to the left moves the grasshopper to a point with a coordinate x - d, while jumping to the right moves him to a point with a coordinate x + d. The grasshopper is very fond of positive integers, so for each integer i starting with 1 the following holds: exactly i minutes after the start he makes a jump with a distance of exactly i. So, in the first minutes he jumps by 1, then by 2, and so on. The direction of a jump is determined as follows: if the point where the grasshopper was before the jump has an even coordinate, the grasshopper jumps to the left, otherwise he jumps to the right. For example, if after 18 consecutive jumps he arrives at the point with a coordinate 7, he will jump by a distance of 19 to the right, since 7 is an odd number, and will end up at a point 7 + 19 = 26.

Having nothing else to do he starts jumping between integer points on the axis. Making a jump from a point with coordinate x with a distance d to the left moves the grasshopper to a point with a coordinate x - d, while jumping to the right moves him to a point with a coordinate x + d. The grasshopper is very fond of positive integers, so for each integer i starting with 1 the following holds: exactly i minutes after the start he makes a jump with a distance of exactly i. So, in the first minutes he jumps by 1, then by 2, and so on. The direction of a jump is determined as follows: if the point where the grasshopper was before the jump has an even coordinate, the grasshopper jumps to the left, otherwise he jumps to the right. For example, if after 18 consecutive jumps he arrives at the point with a coordinate 7, he will jump by a distance of 19 to the right, since 7 is an odd number, and will end up at a point 7 + 19 = 26. Since 26 is an even number, the next jump the grasshopper will make to the left by a distance of 20, and it will move him to the point 26 - 20 = 6.
