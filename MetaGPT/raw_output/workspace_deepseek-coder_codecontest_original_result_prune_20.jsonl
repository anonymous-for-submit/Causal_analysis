Please help her and find the minimum number of symbols she can erase to make string s a palindrome, or tell her that it's impossible. Notice that she can only erase symbols equal to the one letter she chose. A string is a palindrome if it is the same from the left to the right and from the right to the left. For example, the strings 'kek', 'abacaba', 'r' and 'papicipap' are palindromes, while the strings 'abb' and 'iq' are not.\n\nInput The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) — the number of test cases. The next 2 ⋅ t lines contain the description of test cases. The description of each test case consists of two lines. The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the length of the string. The second line of each test case contains the string s consisting of n lowercase English letters.

Each edge has some letter written on it. You have to answer q queries. Each query is described by 4 integers u, v, l and r. The answer to the query is the total number of occurrences of str(u,v) in strings with indices from l to r. str(u,v) is defined as the string that is made by concatenating letters written on the edges on the shortest path from u to v (in order that they are traversed). The first line of the input contains three integers n, m and q (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ m,q ≤ 10^5). The i-th of the following n-1 lines contains two integers u_i, v_i and a lowercase Latin letter c_i (1 ≤ u_i, v_i ≤ n, u_i ≠ v_i), denoting the edge between nodes u_i, v_i with a character c_i on it. It's guaranteed that these edges form a tree. The following m lines contain the strings consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The total length of those strings does not exceed 10^5. Then q lines follow, each containing four integers u, v, l and r (1 ≤ u,v ≤ n, u ≠ v, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ m), denoting the queries.

In return, it will recieve the manhattan distance to the closest square of the enemy base from square (i,j) or -1 if the square you placed the device on is inside the enemy base or outside the grid. \n\nIf you recieve -1 instead of a positive number, exit immidiately and you will see the wrong answer verdict. Otherwise, you can get an arbitrary verdict because your solution will continue to read from a closed stream.\n\nYour solution should use no more than 40 queries.\n\nOnce you are sure where the enemy base is located, you should print \"! x y p q\" (1 ≤ x ≤ p≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ y ≤ q≤ 10^9), where (x, y) is the square inside the enemy base with the smallest x and y coordinates, and (p, q) is the square inside the enemy base with the largest x and y coordinates.\n\nNote that answering doesn't count as one of the 40 queries.\n\nAfter printing a query or printing the answer, do not forget to output end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get idleness limit exceeded.

The ticks could be of different sizes, but the size of each tick is at least k (that is, d ≥ k for all the ticks). Determine whether this field can indeed be obtained by drawing some (possibly none) ticks of sizes d ≥ k or not. Input The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) — the number test cases.

For convenience, let's denote l_u and r_u as the left and the right child of the node u respectively, l_u = 0 if u does not have the left child, and r_u = 0 if the node u does not have the right child. Each node has a string label, initially is a single character c_u. Let's define the string representation of the binary tree as the concatenation of the labels of the nodes in the in-order. Formally, let f(u) be the string representation of the tree rooted at the node u. f(u) is defined as follows: $$$ f(u) = \\begin{cases} <empty string>, & if u = 0; \\\\ f(l_u) + c_u + f(r_u) & otherwise, \\end{cases}  where +$$$ denotes the string concatenation operation. This way, the string representation of the tree is f(1). For each node, we can duplicate its label at most once, that is, assign c_u with c_u + c_u, but only if u is the root of the tree, or if its parent also has its label duplicated. You are given the tree and an integer k. What is the lexicographically smallest string representation of the tree, if we can duplicate labels of at most k nodes? A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if and only if one of the following holds: \\n\\n  * a is a prefix of b, but a ≠ b; \\n  * in the first position where a and b differ, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b. \\n\\nInput The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5). The second line contains a string c of n lower-case English letters, where c_i is the initial label of the node i for 1 ≤ i ≤ n. Note that the given string c is not the initial string representation of the tree. The i-th of the next n lines contains two integers l_i and r_i (0 ≤ l_i, r_i ≤ n). If the node i does not have the left child, l_i = 0, and if the node i does not have the right child, r_i = 0. It is guaranteed that the given input forms a binary tree, rooted at 1.

Mr. Chanek's nephew loves the non-negative integer k. His nephew wants exactly k occurrences of b as substrings in a. However, Mr. Chanek does not know the value of k. So, for each k (0 ≤ k ≤ n - m + 1), find the minimum number of elements in a that have to be changed such that there are exactly k occurrences of b in a. A string s occurs exactly k times in t if there are exactly k different pairs (p,q) such that we can obtain s by deleting p characters from the beginning and q characters from the end of t. Input The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 500) — size of the binary string a and b respectively. The second line contains a binary string a of length n. The third line contains a binary string b of length m. Output Output n - m + 2 integers — the (k+1)-th integer denotes the minimal number of elements in a that have to be changed so there are exactly k occurrences of b as a substring in a.

Each road has a capacity c, denoting the maximum number of vehicles that can be on it, and an associated toll t.

Being the tour organizer, Omkar wants his groups to have as much fun as they possibly can, but also must reimburse his groups for the tolls that they have to pay. Thus, for each tour group, Omkar wants to know two things: first, what is the enjoyment value of the city y with maximum enjoyment value that the tour group can reach from their starting city, and second, how much per vehicle will Omkar have to pay to reimburse the entire group for their trip from x to y?

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2,…, a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) — the happiness value of each attraction. The i-th of the next n - 1 lines contains three integers u_i, v_i, and t_i (1 ≤ u_i, v_i ≤ n, 0 ≤ t_i ≤ 1) — an edge between vertices u_i and v_i with color t_i. The given edges form a tree.

For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array) and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).\n\nInput\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) — the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5).\nThe second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n.
