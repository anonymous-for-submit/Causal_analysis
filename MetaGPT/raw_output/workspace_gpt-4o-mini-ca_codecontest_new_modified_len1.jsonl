Each command is denoted by one of the symbols 'L', 'R', 'D' or 'U', and triggers the movement to left, right, down or up, respectively.\n\nThe robot can start its movement in any cell. The robot executes the commands starting from the first one, strictly in the order in which they are listed in s. If the robot moves beyond the edge of the board, it falls and breaks. A command that causes the robot to break is not considered successfully executed.\n\nThe robot's task is to execute as many commands as possible without falling off the board. For example, on board 3 × 3, if the robot starts a sequence of actions s=\"RRDLUU\" (\"right\", \"right\", \"down\", \"left\", \"up\", \"up\") from the central cell, the robot will perform one command, then the next command will force him to cross the edge.

The second line of the description is a string s consisting solely of characters 'L', 'R', 'D' and 'U' — the sequence of commands the robot executes. The string has a length from 1 to 10^6 commands.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the total length of s over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t lines, each of which contains the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to the test case are two integers r (1 ≤ r ≤ n) and c (1 ≤ c ≤ m), separated by a space — the coordinates of the cell (row number and column number) from which the robot should start moving to perform as many commands as possible.\n\nIf there are several such cells, you may output any of them.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n4\n1 1\nL\n1 2\nL\n3 3\nRRDLUU\n4 3\nLUURRDDLLLUU\n\nOutput\n\n1 1\n1 2\n2 1\n3 2"}, "task": {"Required packages": ["typing"], "Required Other language third-party packages": ["No third-party dependencies required"], "Logic Analysis": [["main.py", "Contains one function with the same input/output format as user requirement"]], "File list": ["main.py"], "Full API spec": "", "Shared Knowledge": "", "Anything UNCLEAR": "Clarification needed on how to handle edge cases where multiple starting positions yield the same maximum commands executed."}, "eval_result": true}

If the robot starts moving from the cell (2, 1) (second row, first column) then all commands will be executed successfully and the robot will stop at the cell (1, 2) (first row, second column).\n\nDetermine the cell from which the robot should start its movement in order to execute as many commands as possible.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) — the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases.\n\nIn the description of each test case, the first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^6) — the height and width of the field that the robot is located on. The second line of the description is a string s consisting solely of characters 'L', 'R', 'D' and 'U' — the sequence of commands the robot executes. The string has a length from 1 to 10^6 commands.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the total length of s over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t lines, each of which contains the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to the test case are two integers r (1 ≤ r ≤ n) and c (1 ≤ c ≤ m), separated by a space — the coordinates of the cell (row number and column number) from which the robot should start moving to perform as many commands as possible.\n\nIf there are several such cells, you may output any of them.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n4\n1 1\nL\n1 2\nL\n3 3\nRRDLUU\n4 3\nLUURRDDLLLUU\n\nOutput\n\n1 1\n1 2\n2 1\n3 2"}, "task": {"Required packages": ["typing"], "Required Other language third-party packages": ["gui_toolkit"], "Logic Analysis": [["main.py", "Contains one function with the same input/output format as user requirement"]], "File list": ["main.py"], "Full API spec": "", "Shared Knowledge": "", "Anything UNCLEAR": "No unclear aspects identified at this time."}, "eval_result": true}

For example, on board 3 × 3, if the robot starts a sequence of actions s=\"RRDLUU\" (\"right\", \"right\", \"down\", \"left\", \"up\", \"up\") from the central cell, the robot will perform one command, then the next command will force him to cross the edge.

First, a new array a^{→ d} is defined as a cyclic shift of the array a to the right by d cells. The elements of this array can be defined as a^{→ d}_i = a_{(i + n - d) mod n}, where (i + n - d) mod n is the remainder of integer division of i + n - d by n. \n\nIt means that the whole array a^{→ d} can be represented as a sequence $$$a^{→ d} = [a_{n - d}, a_{n - d + 1}, …, a_{n - 1}, a_0, a_1, …, a_{n - d - 1}]$$$\n\n  2.

If the robot starts moving from the cell (2, 1) (second row, first column) then all commands will be executed successfully and the robot will stop at the cell (1, 2) (first row, second column).\n\nDetermine the cell from which the robot should start its movement in order to execute as many commands as possible.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) — the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases.\n\nIn the description of each test case, the first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^6) — the height and width of the field that the robot is located on. The second line of the description is a string s consisting solely of characters 'L', 'R', 'D' and 'U' — the sequence of commands the robot executes. The string has a length from 1 to 10^6 commands.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the total length of s over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t lines, each of which contains the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to the test case are two integers r (1 ≤ r ≤ n) and c (1 ≤ c ≤ m), separated by a space — the coordinates of the cell (row number and column number) from which the robot should start moving to perform as many commands as possible.\n\nIf there are several such cells, you may output any of them.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n4\n1 1\nL\n1 2\nL\n3 3\nRRDLUU\n4 3\nLUURRDDLLLUU"}, "task": {"Required packages": ["typing"], "Required Other language third-party packages": ["No third-party dependencies required"], "Logic Analysis": [["main.py", "Contains one function with the same input/output format as user requirement"]], "File list": ["main.py"], "Full API spec": "", "Shared Knowledge": "", "Anything UNCLEAR": "Clarification needed on how to handle edge cases where multiple optimal starting positions exist."}, "eval_result": true}

If there are still elements equal to 1 in the array after the end of the process, print -1.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n5\n2 1\n0 1\n3 2\n0 1 0\n5 2\n1 1 0 1 0\n4 2\n0 1 0 1\n1 1\n0\n\nOutput\n\n1\n1\n3\n-1\n0\n\nNote\nIn the third sample test case the array will change as follows: \n  1. At the beginning a = [1, 1, 0, 1, 0], and a^{→ 2} = [1, 0, 1, 1, 0]. Their element-by-element \"AND\" is equal to $$$[1  \\&  1, 1  \\&  0, 0  \\&  1, 1  \\&  1, 0  \\&  0] = [1, 0, 0, 1, 0]$$$ \n  2. Now a = [1, 0, 0, 1, 0], then a^{→ 2} = [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]. Their element-by-element \"AND\" equals to $$$[1  \\&  1, 0  \\&  0, 0  \\&  1, 1  \\&  0, 0  \\&  0] = [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]$$$ \n  3. And finally, when a = [1, 0, 0, 0, 0] we get a^{→ 2} = [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]. Their element-by-element \"AND\" equals to $$$[1  \\&  0, 0  \\&  0, 0  \\&  1, 0  \\&  0, 0  \\&  0] = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]$$$ \n\nThus, the answer is 3 steps.\n\nIn the fourth sample test case, the array will not change as it shifts by 2 to the right, so each element will be calculated as 0  \\&  0 or 1  \\&  1 thus not changing its value. So the answer is -1, the array will never contain only zeros."}, "task": {"Required packages": ["typing"], "Required Other language third-party packages": ["No third-party dependencies required"], "Logic Analysis": [["main.py", "Contains the function process_binary_arrays which processes multiple test cases of binary arrays according to the specified rules."]], "File list": ["main.py"], "Full API spec": "", "Shared Knowledge": "", "Anything UNCLEAR": "No unclear aspects identified at this time."}, "eval_result": true}

Their element-by-element \"AND\" is equal to $$$[1  \\&  1, 1  \\&  0, 0  \\&  1, 1  \\&  1, 0  \\&  0] = [1, 0, 0, 1, 0]$$$ \n  2. Now a = [1, 0, 0, 1, 0], then a^{→ 2} = [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]. Their element-by-element \"AND\" equals to $$$[1  \\&  1, 0  \\&  0, 0  \\&  1, 1  \\&  0, 0  \\&  0] = [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]$$$ \n  3. And finally, when a = [1, 0, 0, 0, 0] we get a^{→ 2} = [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]. Their element-by-element \"AND\" equals to $$$[1  \\&  0, 0  \\&  0, 0  \\&  1, 0  \\&  0, 0  \\&  0] = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]$$$ \n\nThus, the answer is 3 steps.\n\nIn the fourth sample test case, the array will not change as it shifts by 2 to the right, so each element will be calculated as 0  \\&  0 or 1  \\&  1 thus not changing its value. So the answer is -1, the array will never contain only zeros."}, "task": {"Required packages": ["typing"], "Required Other language third-party packages": ["No third-party dependencies required"], "Logic Analysis": [["main.py", "Contains one function with the same input/output format as user requirement"]], "File list": ["main.py"], "Full API spec": "", "Shared Knowledge": "", "Anything UNCLEAR": "Clarification needed on how to start and initialize third-party libraries."}, "eval_result": true}

Each command is denoted by one of the symbols 'L', 'R', 'D' or 'U', and triggers the movement to left, right, down or up, respectively.\n\nThe robot can start its movement in any cell.

First, a new array a^{→ d} is defined as a cyclic shift of the array a to the right by d cells. The elements of this array can be defined as a^{→ d}_i = a_{(i + n - d) mod n}, where (i + n - d) mod n is the remainder of integer division of i + n - d by n. \n\nIt means that the whole array a^{→ d} can be represented as a sequence $$$a^{→ d} = [a_{n - d}, a_{n - d + 1}, …, a_{n - 1}, a_0, a_1, …, a_{n - d - 1}]$$$\n\n  2. Then each element of the array a_i is replaced by a_i  \\&  a^{→ d}_i, where \\& is a logical \"AND\" operator. \n\nFor example, if a = [0, 0, 1, 1] and d = 1, then a^{→ d} = [1, 0, 0, 1] and the value of a after the first step will be [0  \\&  1, 0  \\&  0, 1  \\&  0, 1  \\&  1], that is [0, 0, 0, 1].\n\nThe process ends when the array stops changing. For a given array a, determine whether it will consist of only zeros at the end of the process. If yes, also find the number of steps the process will take before it finishes.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) — the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases. \n\nThe first line of each test case description contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) — array size and d (1 ≤ d ≤ n) — cyclic shift offset. The second line of the description contains n space-separated integers a_i (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 1) — elements of the array.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to a test case should be a single integer — the number of steps after which the array will contain only zeros for the first time. If there are still elements equal to 1 in the array after the end of the process, print -1.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n5\n2 1\n0 1\n3 2\n0 1 0\n5 2\n1 1 0 1 0\n4 2\n0 1 0 1\n1 1\n0\n\nOutput\n\n1\n1\n3\n-1\n0\n\nNote\nIn the third sample test case the array will change as follows: \n  1. At the beginning a = [1, 1, 0, 1, 0], and a^{→ 2} = [1, 0, 1, 1, 0]. Their element-by-element \"AND\" is equal to $$$[1  \\&  1, 1  \\&  0, 0  \\&  1, 1  \\&  1, 0  \\&  0] = [1, 0, 0, 1, 0]$$$ \n  2. Now a = [1, 0, 0, 1, 0], then a^{→ 2} = [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]. Their element-by-element \"AND\" equals to $$$[1  \\&  1, 0  \\&  0, 0  \\&  1, 1  \\&  0, 0  \\&  0] = [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]$$$ \n  3. And finally, when a = [1, 0, 0, 0, 0] we get a^{→ 2} = [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]. Their element-by-element \"AND\" equals to $$$[1  \\&  0, 0  \\&  0, 0  \\&  1, 0  \\&  0, 0  \\&  0] = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]$$$ \n\nThus, the answer is 3 steps.\n\nIn the fourth sample test case, the array will not change as it shifts by 2 to the right, so each element will be calculated as 0  \\&  0 or 1  \\&  1 thus not changing its value. So the answer is -1, the array will never contain only zeros."}, "task": {"Required packages": ["typing"], "Required Other language third-party packages": ["No third-party dependencies required"], "Logic Analysis": [["main.py", "Contains one function with the same input/output format as user requirement"]], "File list": ["app.py", "dependencies.json"], "Full API spec": "", "Shared Knowledge": "", "Anything UNCLEAR": "Clarification needed on how to start and initialize third-party libraries."}, "eval_result": true}

First, a new array a^{→ d} is defined as a cyclic shift of the array a to the right by d cells. The elements of this array can be defined as a^{→ d}_i = a_{(i + n - d) mod n}, where (i + n - d) mod n is the remainder of integer division of i + n - d by n. \n\nIt means that the whole array a^{→ d} can be represented as a sequence $$$a^{→ d} = [a_{n - d}, a_{n - d + 1}, …, a_{n - 1}, a_0, a_1, …, a_{n - d - 1}]$$$\n\n  2.

The second line of the description contains n space-separated integers a_i (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 1) — elements of the array.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case.

You should perform q queries.\n\nThere are two types of queries:\n\n  * 1 x y — swap p_x and p_y. \n  * 2 i k — print the number that i will become if we assign i = p_i k times. \n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and q (1 ≤ n, q ≤ 10^5).\n\nThe second line contains n integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_n.\n\nEach of the next q lines contains three integers. The first integer is t (1 ≤ t ≤ 2) — type of query. If t = 1, then the next two integers are x and y (1 ≤ x, y ≤ n; x ≠ y) — first-type query. If t = 2, then the next two integers are i and k (1 ≤ i, k ≤ n) — second-type query.\n\nIt is guaranteed that there is at least one second-type query.\n\nOutput\n\nFor every second-type query, print one integer in a new line — answer to this query.\n\nExamples\nInput\n\n\n5 4\n5 3 4 2 1\n2 3 1\n2 1 2\n1 1 3\n2 1 2\n\nOutput\n\n\n4\n1\n2\n\nInput\n\n5 9\n2 3 5 1 4\n2 3 5\n2 5 5\n2 5 1\n2 5 3\n2 5 4\n1 5 4\n2 5 3\n2 2 5\n2 5 1\n\nOutput\n\n\n3\n5\n4\n2\n3\n3\n3\n1\n\nNote\nIn the first example p = \\{5, 3, 4, 2, 1\\}. \n\nThe first query is to print p_3. The answer is 4.\n\nThe second query is to print p_{p_1}. The answer is 1.\n\nThe third query is to swap p_1 and p_3. Now p = \\{4, 3, 5, 2, 1\\}.\n\nThe fourth query is to print p_{p_1}.
