The map of the labyrinth forms a tree with n rooms numbered from 1 to n and n - 1 tunnels connecting them such that it is possible to travel between each pair of rooms through several tunnels. The i-th room (1 ≤ i ≤ n) has a_i illusion rate. To go from the x-th room to the y-th room, there must exist a tunnel between x and y, and it takes max(|a_x + a_y|, |a_x - a_y|) energy. |z| denotes the absolute value of z. To prevent grave robbers, the maze can change the illusion rate of any room in it. Chanek and Indiana would ask q queries. There are two types of queries to be done:\n\n  * 1\\ u\\ c — The illusion rate of the x-th room is changed to c (1 ≤ u ≤ n, 0 ≤ |c| ≤ 10^9). \n  * 2\\ u\\ v — Chanek and Indiana ask you the minimum sum of energy needed to take the secret treasure at room v if they are initially at room u (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n).\n\nInput The first line contains two integers n and q (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ q ≤ 10^5) — the number of rooms in the maze and the number of queries. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (0 ≤ |a_i| ≤ 10^9) — inital illusion rate of each room. The i-th of the next n-1 lines contains two integers s_i and t_i (1 ≤ s_i, t_i ≤ n), meaning there is a tunnel connecting s_i-th room and t_i-th room. The given edges form a tree.

Robot can choose any cell as the starting cell. Its goal is to make the maximum number of steps before it breaks or stops. Determine from which square the robot should start its movement in order to execute as many commands as possible. A command is considered successfully completed if the robot has moved from the square on which that command was written (it does not matter whether to another square or beyond the edge of the board). Input The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10000) — the number of test cases in the test. Each test case's description is preceded by a blank line. Next is a line that contains integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000; 1 ≤ m ≤ 2000) — the height and width of the board. This line followed by n lines, the i-th of which describes the i-th line of the board. Each of them is exactly m letters long and consists of symbols 'L', 'R', 'D' and 'U'. It is guaranteed that the sum of sizes of all boards in the input does not exceed 4⋅10^6. Output For each test case, output three integers r, c and d (1 ≤ r ≤ n; 1 ≤ c ≤ m; d ≥ 0), which denote that the robot should start moving from cell (r, c) to make the maximum number of moves d. If there are several answers, output any of them.\n\nExample Input 7 1 1 R 1 3 RRL 2 2 DL RU 2 2 UD RU 3 2 DL UL RU 4 4 RRRD RUUD URUD ULLR 4 4 DDLU RDDU UUUU RDLD Output 1 1 1 1 1 3 1 1 4 2 1 3 3 1 5 4 3 12 1 1 4", "Project Name": "", "Product Goals": ["Create an engaging user experience", "Improve accessibility, be responsive", "More beautiful UI"], "User Stories": ["As a player, I want to be able to choose difficulty levels", "As a player, I want to see my score after each game", "As a player, I want to get restart button when I lose", "As a player, I want to see beautiful UI that make me feel good", "As a player, I want to play game via mobile phone"], "Competitive Analysis": ["2048 Game A: Simple interface, lacks responsive features", "play2048.co: Beautiful and responsive UI with my best score shown", "2048game.com: Responsive UI with my best score shown, but many ads"], "Competitive Quadrant Chart": "quadrantChart\n    title \"Reach and engagement of campaigns\"\n    x-axis \"Low Reach\" --> \"High Reach\"\n    y-axis \"Low Engagement\" --> \"High Engagement\"\n    quadrant-1 \"We should expand\"\n    quadrant-2 \"Need to promote\"\n    quadrant-3 \"Re-evaluate\"\n    quadrant-4 \"May be improved\"\n    \"Campaign A\": [0.3, 0.6]\n    \"Campaign B\": [0.45, 0.23]\n    \"Campaign C\": [0.57, 0.69]\n    \"Campaign D\": [0.78, 0.34]\n    \"Campaign E\": [0.40, 0.34]\n    \"Campaign F\": [0.35, 0.78]\n    \"Our Target Product\": [0.5, 0.6]", "Requirement Analysis": "The requirements specify the behavior of a robot moving on a checkered board based on the directions given on each cell.
