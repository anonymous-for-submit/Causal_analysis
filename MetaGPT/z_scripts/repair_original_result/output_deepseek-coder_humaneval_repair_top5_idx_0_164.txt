{'Implementation approach': '1. **Define the function**: Start by defining a function named `multiply` that accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, which are expected to be integers.  \n   ```python\n   def multiply(a, b):\n   ```\n\n2. **Extract the unit digits**: To find the unit digit of an integer, use the modulus operator `%` with 10. This gives the remainder of the integer when divided by 10, which corresponds to the unit digit. Apply this to both `a` and `b`.  \n   ```python\n   abs(a % 10)\n   abs(b % 10)\n   ```\n\n3. **Handle negative values**: The requirement specifies that the product of the unit digits should be returned as a positive value.
