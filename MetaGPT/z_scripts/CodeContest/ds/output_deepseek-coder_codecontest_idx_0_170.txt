----------executing task: 8----------
Chanek Jones is back, helping his long-lost relative Indiana Jones, to find a secret treasure in a maze buried below a desert full of illusions.

The map of the labyrinth forms a tree with n rooms numbered from 1 to n and n - 1 tunnels connecting them such that it is possible to travel between each pair of rooms through several tunnels.

The i-th room (1 ≤ i ≤ n) has a_i illusion rate. To go from the x-th room to the y-th room, there must exist a tunnel between x and y, and it takes max(|a_x + a_y|, |a_x - a_y|) energy. |z| denotes the absolute value of z.

To prevent grave robbers, the maze can change the illusion rate of any room in it. Chanek and Indiana would ask q queries.

There are two types of queries to be done:

  * 1\ u\ c — The illusion rate of the x-th room is changed to c (1 ≤ u ≤ n, 0 ≤ |c| ≤ 10^9). 
  * 2\ u\ v — Chanek and Indiana ask you the minimum sum of energy needed to take the secret treasure at room v if they are initially at room u (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n). 



Help them, so you can get a portion of the treasure!

Input

The first line contains two integers n and q (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ q ≤ 10^5) — the number of rooms in the maze and the number of queries.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (0 ≤ |a_i| ≤ 10^9) — inital illusion rate of each room.

The i-th of the next n-1 lines contains two integers s_i and t_i (1 ≤ s_i, t_i ≤ n), meaning there is a tunnel connecting s_i-th room and t_i-th room. The given edges form a tree.

The next q lines contain the query as described. The given queries are valid.

Output

For each type 2 query, output a line containing an integer — the minimum sum of energy needed for Chanek and Indiana to take the secret treasure.

In the first query, their movement from the 1-st to the 2-nd room is as follows.

  * 1 → 5 — takes max(|10 + 4|, |10 - 4|) = 14 energy. 
  * 5 → 6 — takes max(|4 + (-6)|, |4 - (-6)|) = 10 energy. 
  * 6 → 2 — takes max(|-6 + (-9)|, |-6 - (-9)|) = 15 energy. 

In total, it takes 39 energy.

In the second query, the illusion rate of the 1-st room changes from 10 to -3.

In the third query, their movement from the 1-st to the 2-nd room is as follows.

  * 1 → 5 — takes max(|-3 + 4|, |-3 - 4|) = 7 energy. 
  * 5 → 6 — takes max(|4 + (-6)|, |4 - (-6)|) = 10 energy. 
  * 6 → 2 — takes max(|-6 + (-9)|, |-6 - (-9)|) = 15 energy. 



Now, it takes 32 energy.
