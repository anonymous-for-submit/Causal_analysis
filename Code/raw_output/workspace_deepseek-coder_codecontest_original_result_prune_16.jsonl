Today, you're working with a long strip, with height 1 and length n, some positions of which are occupied by 1 by 1 Lego pieces. In one second, you can either remove two adjacent Lego pieces from the strip (if both are present), or add two Lego pieces to adjacent positions (if both are absent). You can only add or remove Lego's at two adjacent positions at the same time, as otherwise your chubby fingers run into precision issues. You want to know exactly how much time you'll spend playing with Legos. You value efficiency, so given some starting state and some ending state, you'll always spend the least number of seconds to transform the starting state into the ending state. If it's impossible to transform the starting state into the ending state, you just skip it (so you spend 0 seconds). The issue is that, for some positions, you don't remember whether there were Legos there or not (in either the starting state, the ending state, or both). Over all pairs of (starting state, ending state) that are consistent with your memory, find the total amount of time it will take to transform the starting state to the ending state.

The first line contains a single integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of columns. The next two lines describe the level. The i-th of these lines describes the i-th line of the level — the line consists of the characters '0' and '1'. The character '0' corresponds to a safe cell, the character '1' corresponds to a trap cell. Additional constraint on the input: cells (1, 1) and (2, n) are safe. Output For each test case, output YES if it is possible to complete the level, and NO otherwise.

In this problem, we are talking about a variant of the game when the players are sitting at the table and everyone plays individually (i.e. not teams, but individual gamers play). n people gathered in a room with m tables (n ≥ 2m). They want to play the Hat k times. Thus, k games will be played at each table. Each player will play in k games. To do this, they are distributed among the tables for each game.

For this reason, they are looking for a schedule (table distribution for each game) such that: At any table in each game there are either ⌊n/m⌋ people or ⌈n/m⌉ people (that is, either n/m rounded down, or n/m rounded up).

Initially, all cells of the field are white. Let us denote the cell with coordinates i vertically and j horizontally by (i, j). The upper left cell will be referred to as (1, 1) and the lower right cell as (n, m). Casimir draws ticks of different sizes on the field. A tick of size d (d > 0) with its center in cell (i, j) is drawn as follows: 1. First, the center cell (i, j) is painted black. 2. Then exactly d cells on the top-left diagonally to the center and exactly d cells on the top-right diagonally to the center are also painted black. 3. That is all the cells with coordinates (i - h, j ± h) for all h between 0 and d are painted. In particular, a tick consists of 2d + 1 black cells. An already painted cell will remain black if painted again. Below you can find an example of the 4 × 9 box, with two ticks of sizes 2 and 3. <image> You are given a description of a checkered field of size n × m. Casimir claims that this field came about after he drew some (possibly 0) ticks on it.

A tick of size d (d > 0) with its center in cell (i, j) is drawn as follows: 1. First, the center cell (i, j) is painted black. 2. Then exactly d cells on the top-left diagonally to the center and exactly d cells on the top-right diagonally to the center are also painted black. 3. That is all the cells with coordinates (i - h, j ± h) for all h between 0 and d are painted. In particular, a tick consists of 2d + 1 black cells.

The box contains n chocolates. The i-th chocolate has a non-negative integer type a_i. Icy believes that good things come in pairs. Unfortunately, all types of chocolates are distinct (all a_i are distinct). Icy wants to make at least one pair of chocolates the same type. As a result, she asks her grandparents to perform some chocolate exchanges. Before performing any chocolate exchanges, Icy chooses two chocolates with indices x and y (1 ≤ x, y ≤ n, x ≠ y). In a chocolate exchange, Icy's grandparents choose a non-negative integer k, such that 2^k ≥ a_x, and change the type of the chocolate x from a_x to 2^k - a_x (that is, perform a_x := 2^k - a_x). The chocolate exchanges will be stopped only when a_x = a_y. Note that other pairs of equal chocolate types do not stop the procedure. Icy's grandparents are smart, so they would choose the sequence of chocolate exchanges that minimizes the number of exchanges needed. Since Icy likes causing trouble, she wants to maximize the minimum number of exchanges needed by choosing x and y appropriately. She wonders what is the optimal pair (x, y) such that the minimum number of exchanges needed is maximized across all possible choices of (x, y). Input The first line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) — the number of chocolates. The second line of the input contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). It is guaranteed that all a_i are distinct. Output Output three integers x, y, and m. x and y are indices of the optimal chocolates to perform exchanges on. Your output must satisfy 1 ≤ x, y ≤ n, x ≠ y. m is the number of exchanges needed to obtain a_x = a_y. We can show that m ≤ 10^9 for any pair of chocolates. If there are multiple solutions, output any.\n\nExamples Input 5 5 6 7 8 9 Output 2 5 5 Input 2 4 8 Output 1 2 2 Note In the first test case, the minimum number of exchanges needed to exchange a chocolate of type 6 to a chocolate of type 9 is 5.

You have a perfect binary tree of 2^k - 1 nodes — a binary tree where all vertices i from 1 to 2^{k - 1} - 1 have exactly two children: vertices 2i and 2i + 1. Vertices from 2^{k - 1} to 2^k - 1 don't have any children. You want to color its vertices with the 6 Rubik's cube colors (White, Green, Red, Blue, Orange and Yellow). Let's call a coloring good when all edges connect nodes with colors that are neighboring sides in the Rubik's cube. More formally: a white node can not be neighboring with white and yellow nodes; a yellow node can not be neighboring with white and yellow nodes; a green node can not be neighboring with green and blue nodes; a blue node can not be neighboring with green and blue nodes; a red node can not be neighboring with red and orange nodes; an orange node can not be neighboring with red and orange nodes.

The i-th attack is performed at the beginning of the a_i-th second from the battle start. The dagger itself does not deal damage, but it applies a poison effect on the dragon, which deals 1 damage during each of the next k seconds (starting with the same second when the dragon was stabbed by the dagger). However, if the dragon has already been poisoned, then the dagger updates the poison effect (i.e. cancels the current poison effect and applies a new one). For example, suppose k = 4, and Monocarp stabs the dragon during the seconds 2, 4 and 10. Then the poison effect is applied at the start of the 2-nd second and deals 1 damage during the 2-nd and 3-rd seconds; then, at the beginning of the 4-th second, the poison effect is reapplied, so it deals exactly 1 damage during the seconds 4, 5, 6 and 7; then, during the 10-th second, the poison effect is applied again, and it deals 1 damage during the seconds 10, 11, 12 and 13. In total, the dragon receives 10 damage. Monocarp knows that the dragon has h hit points, and if he deals at least h damage to the dragon during the battle — he slays the dragon.

In this game, his character has to kill a dragon. The battle with the dragon lasts 100^{500} seconds, during which Monocarp attacks the dragon with a poisoned dagger. The i-th attack is performed at the beginning of the a_i-th second from the battle start. The dagger itself does not deal damage, but it applies a poison effect on the dragon, which deals 1 damage during each of the next k seconds (starting with the same second when the dragon was stabbed by the dagger). However, if the dragon has already been poisoned, then the dagger updates the poison effect (i.e. cancels the current poison effect and applies a new one). For example, suppose k = 4, and Monocarp stabs the dragon during the seconds 2, 4 and 10. Then the poison effect is applied at the start of the 2-nd second and deals 1 damage during the 2-nd and 3-rd seconds; then, at the beginning of the 4-th second, the poison effect is reapplied, so it deals exactly 1 damage during the seconds 4, 5, 6 and 7; then, during the 10-th second, the poison effect is applied again, and it deals 1 damage during the seconds 10, 11, 12 and 13. In total, the dragon receives 10 damage. Monocarp knows that the dragon has h hit points, and if he deals at least h damage to the dragon during the battle — he slays the dragon.

There are n stations numbered from 1 to n and m two-way railways in Gensokyo. Every two-way railway connects two different stations and has a positive integer length d. No two two-way railways connect the same two stations. Besides, it is possible to travel from any station to any other using those railways. Among these n stations, station 1 is the main station. You can get to any station from any other station using only two-way railways. Because of the technological limitation, Nitori can only construct one-way railways, whose length can be arbitrary positive integer. Constructing a one-way railway from station u will costs w_u units of resources, no matter where the railway ends. To ease the congestion, Nitori plans that after construction there are at least two shortest paths from station 1 to any other station, and these two shortest paths do not pass the same station except station 1 and the terminal. Besides, Nitori also does not want to change the distance of the shortest path from station 1 to any other station. Due to various reasons, sometimes the cost of building a new railway will increase uncontrollably. There will be a total of q occurrences of this kind of incident, and the i-th event will add additional amount of x_i to the cost of building a new railway from the station k_i.

Having nothing else to do he starts jumping between integer points on the axis. Making a jump from a point with coordinate x with a distance d to the left moves the grasshopper to a point with a coordinate x - d, while jumping to the right moves him to a point with a coordinate x + d. The grasshopper is very fond of positive integers, so for each integer i starting with 1 the following holds: exactly i minutes after the start he makes a jump with a distance of exactly i. So, in the first minutes he jumps by 1, then by 2, and so on. The direction of a jump is determined as follows: if the point where the grasshopper was before the jump has an even coordinate, the grasshopper jumps to the left, otherwise he jumps to the right. For example, if after 18 consecutive jumps he arrives at the point with a coordinate 7, he will jump by a distance of 19 to the right, since 7 is an odd number, and will end up at a point 7 + 19 = 26. Since 26 is an even number, the next jump the grasshopper will make to the left by a distance of 20, and it will move him to the point 26 - 20 = 6. Find exactly which point the grasshopper will be at after exactly n jumps. Input The first line of input contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) — the number of test cases. Each of the following t lines contains two integers x_0 (-10^{14} ≤ x_0 ≤ 10^{14}) and n (0 ≤ n ≤ 10^{14}) — the coordinate of the grasshopper's initial position and the number of jumps.

The grasshopper is very fond of positive integers, so for each integer i starting with 1 the following holds: exactly i minutes after the start he makes a jump with a distance of exactly i.
