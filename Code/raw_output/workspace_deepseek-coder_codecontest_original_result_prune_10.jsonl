This game has a unique trading mechanics. To trade with a character, Monocarp has to choose one of the items he possesses and trade it for some item the other character possesses. Each item has an integer price. If Monocarp's chosen item has price x, then he can trade it for any item (exactly one item) with price not greater than x+k. Monocarp initially has n items, the price of the i-th item he has is a_i. The character Monocarp is trading with has m items, the price of the i-th item they have is b_i. Monocarp can trade with this character as many times as he wants (possibly even zero times), each time exchanging one of his items with one of the other character's items according to the aforementioned constraints. Note that if Monocarp gets some item during an exchange, he can trade it for another item (since now the item belongs to him), and vice versa: if Monocarp trades one of his items for another item, he can get his item back by trading something for it. You have to answer q queries. Each query consists of one integer, which is the value of k, and asks you to calculate the maximum possible total cost of items Monocarp can have after some sequence of trades, assuming that he can trade an item of cost x for an item of cost not greater than x+k during each trade.

This game has a unique trading mechanics. To trade with a character, Monocarp has to choose one of the items he possesses and trade it for some item the other character possesses. Each item has an integer price. If Monocarp's chosen item has price x, then he can trade it for any item (exactly one item) with price not greater than x+k. Monocarp initially has n items, the price of the i-th item he has is a_i. The character Monocarp is trading with has m items, the price of the i-th item they have is b_i. Monocarp can trade with this character as many times as he wants (possibly even zero times), each time exchanging one of his items with one of the other character's items according to the aforementioned constraints. Note that if Monocarp gets some item during an exchange, he can trade it for another item (since now the item belongs to him), and vice versa: if Monocarp trades one of his items for another item, he can get his item back by trading something for it. You have to answer q queries. Each query consists of one integer, which is the value of k, and asks you to calculate the maximum possible total cost of items Monocarp can have after some sequence of trades, assuming that he can trade an item of cost x for an item of cost not greater than x+k during each trade. Note that the queries are independent: the trades do not actually occur, Monocarp only wants to calculate the maximum total cost he can get. Input The first line contains three integers n, m and q (1 ≤ n, m, q ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) — the prices of the items Monocarp has.

Today, you're working with a long strip, with height 1 and length n, some positions of which are occupied by 1 by 1 Lego pieces. In one second, you can either remove two adjacent Lego pieces from the strip (if both are present), or add two Lego pieces to adjacent positions (if both are absent). You can only add or remove Lego's at two adjacent positions at the same time, as otherwise your chubby fingers run into precision issues. You want to know exactly how much time you'll spend playing with Legos. You value efficiency, so given some starting state and some ending state, you'll always spend the least number of seconds to transform the starting state into the ending state. If it's impossible to transform the starting state into the ending state, you just skip it (so you spend 0 seconds). The issue is that, for some positions, you don't remember whether there were Legos there or not (in either the starting state, the ending state, or both). Over all pairs of (starting state, ending state) that are consistent with your memory, find the total amount of time it will take to transform the starting state to the ending state.

There can be multiple comments for the same pair of (i, j).\n\nThere is guaranteed that the sum of all n does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5 and the sum of all m does not exceed 5 ⋅ 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print one integer — the maximum possible number of imposters. If the comments contradict each other, print -1.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n5\n3 2\n1 2 imposter\n2 3 crewmate\n5 4\n1 3 crewmate\n2 5 crewmate\n2 4 imposter\n3 4 imposter\n2 2\n1 2 imposter\n2 1 crewmate\n3 5\n1 2 imposter\n1 2 imposter\n3 2 crewmate\n3 2 crewmate\n1 3 imposter\n5 0\n\nOutput\n\n2\n4\n-1\n2\n5\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case, imposters can be Andreas 2 and 3.\n\nIn the second test case, imposters can be Andreas 1, 2, 3 and 5.\n\nIn the third test case, comments contradict each other. This is because player 1 says that player 2 is an imposter, and player 2 says that player 1 is a crewmate. If player 1 is a crewmate, then he must be telling the truth, so player 2 must be an imposter. But if player 2 is an imposter then he must be lying, so player 1 can't be a crewmate.

The vertex 1 is the root. You are to answer some questions about the tree. A tree is a connected graph without cycles. A rooted tree has a special vertex called the root. The parent of a node v is the next vertex on the shortest path from v to the root. Each question is defined by three integers v, l, and k. To get the answer to the question, you need to perform the following steps: First, write down the sequence of all integers written on the shortest path from the vertex v to the root (including those written in the v and the root). Count the number of times each integer occurs. Remove all integers with less than l occurrences. Replace the sequence, removing all duplicates and ordering the elements by the number of occurrences in the original list in increasing order. In case of a tie, you can choose the order of these elements arbitrary. The answer to the question is the k-th number in the remaining sequence. Note that the answer is not always uniquely determined, because there could be several orderings. Also, it is possible that the length of the sequence on this step is less than k, in this case the answer is -1. For example, if the sequence of integers on the path from v to the root is [2, 2, 1, 7, 1, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4], l = 2 and k = 2, then the answer is 1. Please answer all questions about the tree.

The vertex 1 is the root. You are to answer some questions about the tree. A tree is a connected graph without cycles. A rooted tree has a special vertex called the root. The parent of a node v is the next vertex on the shortest path from v to the root. Each question is defined by three integers v, l, and k. To get the answer to the question, you need to perform the following steps: First, write down the sequence of all integers written on the shortest path from the vertex v to the root (including those written in the v and the root). Count the number of times each integer occurs. Remove all integers with less than l occurrences. Replace the sequence, removing all duplicates and ordering the elements by the number of occurrences in the original list in increasing order. In case of a tie, you can choose the order of these elements arbitrary. The answer to the question is the k-th number in the remaining sequence. Note that the answer is not always uniquely determined, because there could be several orderings. Also, it is possible that the length of the sequence on this step is less than k, in this case the answer is -1. For example, if the sequence of integers on the path from v to the root is [2, 2, 1, 7, 1, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4], l = 2 and k = 2, then the answer is 1. Please answer all questions about the tree. Input Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^6). Description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two integers n, q (1 ≤ n, q ≤ 10^6) — the number of vertices in the tree and the number of questions.

The i-th song had its predicted rating equal to p_i, where 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n and every integer from 1 to n appears exactly once. In other words, p is a permutation. After listening to each of them, Monocarp pressed either a like or a dislike button. Let his vote sequence be represented with a string s, such that s_i=0 means that he disliked the i-th song, and s_i=1 means that he liked it. Now the service has to re-evaluate the song ratings in such a way that: the new ratings q_1, q_2, ..., q_n still form a permutation (1 ≤ q_i ≤ n; each integer from 1 to n appears exactly once); every song that Monocarp liked should have a greater rating than every song that Monocarp disliked (formally, for all i, j such that s_i=1 and s_j=0, q_i>q_j should hold).

Note that each number i has a probability of 1/n to be picked. * Randomly Pick a number j satisfying 0 ≤ j < k. * Change the value of b_i to j. It is possible for b_i to be changed to the same value. Denote f(b) as the expected number of operations done to b until all elements of b are equal. You are given two integers n and k, and an array a (-1 ≤ a_i < k) of n integers.

The floor consists of n rows and m columns. The rows of the floor are numbered from 1 to n from top to bottom, and columns of the floor are numbered from 1 to m from left to right. The cell on the intersection of the r-th row and the c-th column is denoted as (r,c). The initial position of the robot is (r_b, c_b). In one second, the robot moves by dr rows and dc columns, that is, after one second, the robot moves from the cell (r, c) to (r + dr, c + dc). Initially dr = 1, dc = 1. If there is a vertical wall (the left or the right walls) in the movement direction, dc is reflected before the movement, so the new value of dc is -dc. And if there is a horizontal wall (the upper or lower walls), dr is reflected before the movement, so the new value of dr is -dr. Each second (including the moment before the robot starts moving), the robot cleans every cell lying in the same row or the same column as its position. There is only one dirty cell at (r_d, c_d). The job of the robot is to clean that dirty cell. Input Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). Description of the test cases follows. A test case consists of only one line, containing six integers n, m, r_b, c_b, r_d, and c_d (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100, 1 ≤ r_b, r_d ≤ n, 1 ≤ c_b, c_d ≤ m) — the sizes of the room, the initial position of the robot and the position of the dirt cell. Output For each test case, print an integer — the time for the robot to clean the dirty cell. We can show that the robot always cleans the dirty cell eventually.\n\nExample Input 5 10 10 6 1 2 8 10 10 9 9 1 1 9 8 5 6 2 1 6 9 2 2 5 8 2 2 1 1 2 1 Output 7 10 9 3 0 Note In the first example, the floor has the size of 10× 10.

There are n cities in Omkarland, and, rather curiously, there are exactly n-1 bidirectional roads connecting the cities to each other. It is guaranteed that you can reach any city from any other city through the road network. Every city has an enjoyment value e. Each road has a capacity c, denoting the maximum number of vehicles that can be on it, and an associated toll t. However, the toll system in Omkarland has an interesting quirk: if a vehicle travels on multiple roads on a single journey, they pay only the highest toll of any single road on which they traveled. (In other words, they pay max t over all the roads on which they traveled.) If a vehicle traverses no roads, they pay 0 toll. Omkar has decided to host q tour groups. Each tour group consists of v vehicles starting at city x. (Keep in mind that a tour group with v vehicles can travel only on roads with capacity ≥ v.) Being the tour organizer, Omkar wants his groups to have as much fun as they possibly can, but also must reimburse his groups for the tolls that they have to pay. Thus, for each tour group, Omkar wants to know two things: first, what is the enjoyment value of the city y with maximum enjoyment value that the tour group can reach from their starting city, and second, how much per vehicle will Omkar have to pay to reimburse the entire group for their trip from x to y? (This trip from x to y will always be on the shortest path from x to y.) In the case that there are multiple reachable cities with the maximum enjoyment value, Omkar will let his tour group choose which one they want to go to.

There are n cities in Omkarland, and, rather curiously, there are exactly n-1 bidirectional roads connecting the cities to each other. It is guaranteed that you can reach any city from any other city through the road network. Every city has an enjoyment value e. Each road has a capacity c, denoting the maximum number of vehicles that can be on it, and an associated toll t. However, the toll system in Omkarland has an interesting quirk: if a vehicle travels on multiple roads on a single journey, they pay only the highest toll of any single road on which they traveled. (In other words, they pay max t over all the roads on which they traveled.) If a vehicle traverses no roads, they pay 0 toll. Omkar has decided to host q tour groups. Each tour group consists of v vehicles starting at city x. (Keep in mind that a tour group with v vehicles can travel only on roads with capacity ≥ v.) Being the tour organizer, Omkar wants his groups to have as much fun as they possibly can, but also must reimburse his groups for the tolls that they have to pay. Thus, for each tour group, Omkar wants to know two things: first, what is the enjoyment value of the city y with maximum enjoyment value that the tour group can reach from their starting city, and second, how much per vehicle will Omkar have to pay to reimburse the entire group for their trip from x to y? (This trip from x to y will always be on the shortest path from x to y.) In the case that there are multiple reachable cities with the maximum enjoyment value, Omkar will let his tour group choose which one they want to go to. Therefore, to prepare for all possible scenarios, he wants to know the amount of money per vehicle that he needs to guarantee that he can reimburse the group regardless of which city they choose.\n\nInput The first line contains two integers n and q (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5), representing the number of cities and the number of groups, respectively.

Recently he found a similar game and there are such rules. There are mines on the field, for each the coordinates of its location are known (x_i, y_i). Each mine has a lifetime in seconds, after which it will explode. After the explosion, the mine also detonates all mines vertically and horizontally at a distance of k (two perpendicular lines). As a result, we get an explosion on the field in the form of a \"plus\" symbol ('+'). Thus, one explosion can cause new explosions, and so on. Also, Polycarp can detonate anyone mine every second, starting from zero seconds. After that, a chain reaction of explosions also takes place. Mines explode instantly and also instantly detonate other mines according to the rules described above. Polycarp wants to set a new record and asks you to help him calculate in what minimum number of seconds all mines can be detonated. Input The first line of the input contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) — the number of test cases in the test. An empty line is written in front of each test suite. Next comes a line that contains integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^9) — the number of mines and the distance that hit by mines during the explosion, respectively. Then n lines follow, the i-th of which describes the x and y coordinates of the i-th mine and the time until its explosion (-10^9 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9, 0 ≤ timer ≤ 10^9). It is guaranteed that all mines have different coordinates. Output Print t lines, each of the lines must contain the answer to the corresponding set of input data — the minimum number of seconds it takes to explode all the mines.
