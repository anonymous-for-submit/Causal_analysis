A comment has the structure of \"i j c\" where i and j are two distinct integers and c is a string (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n; i ≠ j; c is either imposter or crewmate). The comment means that player i said that player j has the role c. An imposter always lies, and a crewmate always tells the truth. \n\nHelp Theofanis find the maximum possible number of imposters among all the other Cypriot players, or determine that the comments contradict each other (see the notes for further explanation).

Its developers are currently working on a song recommendation module. So imagine Monocarp got recommended n songs, numbered from 1 to n. The i-th song had its predicted rating equal to p_i, where 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n and every integer from 1 to n appears exactly once. In other words, p is a permutation. After listening to each of them, Monocarp pressed either a like or a dislike button. Let his vote sequence be represented with a string s, such that s_i=0 means that he disliked the i-th song, and s_i=1 means that he liked it. Now the service has to re-evaluate the song ratings in such a way that: the new ratings q_1, q_2, ..., q_n still form a permutation (1 ≤ q_i ≤ n; each integer from 1 to n appears exactly once); every song that Monocarp liked should have a greater rating than every song that Monocarp disliked (formally, for all i, j such that s_i=1 and s_j=0, q_i>q_j should hold). Among all valid permutations q find the one that has the smallest value of ∑_{i=1}^n |p_i-q_i|, where |x| is an absolute value of x. Print the permutation q_1, q_2, ..., q_n.

Then exactly d cells on the top-left diagonally to the center and exactly d cells on the top-right diagonally to the center are also painted black. 3. That is all the cells with coordinates (i - h, j ± h) for all h between 0 and d are painted. In particular, a tick consists of 2d + 1 black cells. An already painted cell will remain black if painted again. Below you can find an example of the 4 × 9 box, with two ticks of sizes 2 and 3. <image> You are given a description of a checkered field of size n × m. Casimir claims that this field came about after he drew some (possibly 0) ticks on it. The ticks could be of different sizes, but the size of each tick is at least k (that is, d ≥ k for all the ticks). Determine whether this field can indeed be obtained by drawing some (possibly none) ticks of sizes d ≥ k or not. Input The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) — the number test cases. The following lines contain the descriptions of the test cases. The first line of the test case description contains the integers n, m, and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10; 1 ≤ m ≤ 19) — the field size and the minimum size of the ticks that Casimir drew. The following n lines describe the field: each line consists of m characters either being '.' if the corresponding cell is not yet painted or '*' otherwise. Output Print t lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to a test case should be YES if the given field can be obtained by drawing ticks of at least the given size and NO otherwise. You may print every letter in any case you want (so, for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive answers)."}, "task": {"Required packages": [], "Required Other language third-party packages": [], "Logic Analysis": [], "File list": ["main.py"], "Full API spec": "", "Shared Knowledge": "", "Anything UNCLEAR": ""}, "eval_result": true}

All letters must be uppercase. \n\nIf you print UNIQUE, then print n additional lines with n characters in each line, such that the i-th character in the j^{th} line is S if the tile in row i and column j of the mastapeece is sinoper, and G if it is glaucous. \n\nExamples \n\nInput \n\n4 \nS... \n..G. \n.... \n...S \n\nOutput \n\nMULTIPLE \n\nInput \n\n6 \nS..... \n....G. \n..S... \n.....S \n....G. \nG..... \n\nOutput \n\nNONE \n\nInput \n\n10 \n.S....S... \n.......... \n...SSS.... \n.......... \n.......... \n...GS..... \n....G...G. \n.......... \n......G... \n.......... \n\nOutput \n\nUNIQUE \nSSSSSSSSSS \nSGGGGGGGGS \nSGSSSSSSGS \nSGSGGGGSGS \nSGSGSSGSGS \nSGSGSSGSGS \nSGSGGGGSGS \nSGSSSSSSGS \nSGGGGGGGGS \nSSSSSSSSSS \n\nInput \n\n1 \n. \n\nOutput \n\nNONE \n\nNote \n\nFor the first test case, Omkar can make the mastapeeces \nSSSS \nSGGS \nSGGS \nSSSS \nand \nSSGG \nSSGG \nGGSS \nGGSS. \n\nFor the second test case, it can be proven that it is impossible for Omkar to add tiles to create a mastapeece. \n\nFor the third case, it can be proven that the given mastapece is the only mastapece Omkar can create by adding tiles. \n\nFor the fourth test case, it's clearly impossible for the only tile in any mosaic Omkar creates to be adjacent to two tiles of the same color, as it will be adjacent to 0 tiles total. \n"}, "task": {"Required packages": [], "Required Other language third-party packages": [], "Logic Analysis": [], "File list": ["main.py"], "Full API spec": "", "Shared Knowledge": "", "Anything UNCLEAR": ""}, "eval_result": true}

The robot can start its movement in any cell. He then moves to the adjacent square in the direction indicated on the current square in one move. If the robot moves beyond the edge of the board, it falls and breaks. If the robot appears in the cell it already visited before, it breaks (it stops and doesn't move anymore). Robot can choose any cell as the starting cell. Its goal is to make the maximum number of steps before it breaks or stops. Determine from which square the robot should start its movement in order to execute as many commands as possible. A command is considered successfully completed if the robot has moved from the square on which that command was written (it does not matter whether to another square or beyond the edge of the board). Input The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10000) — the number of test cases in the test. Each test case's description is preceded by a blank line. Next is a line that contains integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000; 1 ≤ m ≤ 2000) — the height and width of the board. This line followed by n lines, the i-th of which describes the i-th line of the board. Each of them is exactly m letters long and consists of symbols 'L', 'R', 'D' and 'U'. It is guaranteed that the sum of sizes of all boards in the input does not exceed 4⋅10^6. Output For each test case, output three integers r, c and d (1 ≤ r ≤ n; 1 ≤ c ≤ m; d ≥ 0), which denote that the robot should start moving from cell (r, c) to make the maximum number of moves d. If there are several answers, output any of them.\n\nExample Input 7 1 1 R 1 3 RRL 2 2 DL RU 2 2 UD RU 3 2 DL UL RU 4 4 RRRD RUUD URUD ULLR 4 4 DDLU RDDU UUUU RDLD Output 1 1 1 1 1 3 1 1 4 2 1 3 3 1 5 4 3 12 1 1 4"}, "task": {"Required packages": [], "Required Other language third-party packages": [], "Logic Analysis": [], "File list": ["main.py"], "Full API spec": "", "Shared Knowledge": "", "Anything UNCLEAR": ""}, "eval_result": true}

A string s occurs exactly k times in t if there are exactly k different pairs (p,q) such that we can obtain s by deleting p characters from the beginning and q characters from the end of t. Input The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 500) — size of the binary string a and b respectively. The second line contains a binary string a of length n. The third line contains a binary string b of length m.

Each road has a capacity c, denoting the maximum number of vehicles that can be on it, and an associated toll t. However, the toll system in Omkarland has an interesting quirk: if a vehicle travels on multiple roads on a single journey, they pay only the highest toll of any single road on which they traveled.

Being the tour organizer, Omkar wants his groups to have as much fun as they possibly can, but also must reimburse his groups for the tolls that they have to pay. Thus, for each tour group, Omkar wants to know two things: first, what is the enjoyment value of the city y with maximum enjoyment value that the tour group can reach from their starting city, and second, how much per vehicle will Omkar have to pay to reimburse the entire group for their trip from x to y?

If it is impossible, output -1.\n\nA permutation is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array) and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).\n\nInput\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) — the number of test cases.
