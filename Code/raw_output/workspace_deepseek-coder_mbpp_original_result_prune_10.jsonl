We will first check if the two binary strings are of the same length, as direct swapping is only possible between strings of equal length. If the lengths are not equal, we will return 'Not Possible'. If the lengths are equal, we will then count the number of positions where the corresponding bits are different. Each swap can correct one such discrepancy. We will implement this logic in a Python function.", "File list": [], "Data structures and interfaces": "def min_Swaps(bin1: str, bin2: str) -> typing.Union[int, str]:  # bin1 and bin2 are binary strings, returns the minimum number of swaps or 'Not Possible'", "Program call flow": "", "Anything UNCLEAR": ""}, "task": {"Required packages": [], "Required Other language third-party packages": [], "Logic Analysis": [], "File list": ["main.py"], "Full API spec": "", "Shared Knowledge": "", "Anything UNCLEAR": ""}, "eval_result": true}
