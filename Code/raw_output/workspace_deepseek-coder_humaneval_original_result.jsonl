The feelings and thoughts you have at that moment are\n    definitely worth noting down and comparing. Your task is to determine if a person correctly guessed the results of a number of matches. You are given two arrays of scores and guesses of equal length, where each index shows a match. Return an array of the same length denoting how far off each guess was. If they have guessed correctly, the value is 0, and if not, the value is the absolute difference between the guess and the score.\n\n    example:\n\n    compare([1,2,3,4,5,1],[1,2,3,4,2,-2]) -> [0,0,0,0,3,3]\n    compare([0,5,0,0,0,4],[4,1,1,0,0,-2]) -> [4,4,1,0,0,6]\n    \"\"\"", "Product Goals": ["Create an engaging user experience", "Improve accessibility, be responsive", "More beautiful UI"], "User Stories": ["As a player, I want to be able to choose difficulty levels", "As a player, I want to see my score after each game", "As a player, I want to get restart button when I lose", "As a player, I want to see beautiful UI that make me feel good", "As a player, I want to play game via mobile phone"], "Competitive Analysis": ["2048 Game A: Simple interface, lacks responsive features", "play2048.co: Beautiful and responsive UI with my best score shown", "2048game.com: Responsive UI with my best score shown, but many ads"], "Competitive Quadrant Chart": "quadrantChart\n    title \"Reach and engagement of campaigns\"\n    x-axis \"Low Reach\" --> \"High Reach\"\n    y-axis \"Low Engagement\" --> \"High Engagement\"\n    quadrant-1 \"We should expand\"\n    quadrant-2 \"Need to promote\"\n    quadrant-3 \"Re-evaluate\"\n    quadrant-4 \"May be improved\"\n    \"Campaign A\": [0.3, 0.6]\n    \"Campaign B\": [0.45, 0.23]\n    \"Campaign C\": [0.57, 0.69]\n    \"Campaign D\": [0.78, 0.34]\n    \"Campaign E\": [0.40, 0.34]\n    \"Campaign F\": [0.35, 0.78]\n    \"Our Target Product\": [0.5, 0.6]", "Requirement Analysis": "The requirement is to create a function that compares the scores of matches with the guesses made by a person.
