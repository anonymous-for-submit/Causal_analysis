The default behavior of `split()` will handle multiple spaces correctly by ignoring them.\n   ```python\n   s.split(' ')\n   ```\n\n3. **Sort Each Word**: Use a list comprehension to iterate over each word in the list obtained from the split operation. For each word `i`, convert it into a list of characters using `list(i)`, and then use the `sorted` function to sort these characters in ascending order based on their ASCII values.\n   ```python\n   sorted(list(i))\n   ```\n\n4. **Join Sorted Characters Back into Words**: Use `''.join()` to convert the sorted list of characters back into a string (i.e., a word).\n   ```python\n   ''.join(sorted(list(i)))\n   ```\n\n5. **Reassemble the Words into a Sentence**: After sorting and joining each word, use another join operation to concatenate the words back into a single string, ensuring that there is a space between each word. This maintains the order of words and any blank spaces in the original sentence.\n   ```python\n   ' '.join([...])\n   ```\n\n6. **Return the Result**: Finally, return the newly constructed string from the function.\n   ```python\n   return ' '.join([''.join(sorted(list(i))) for i in s.split(' ')])\n   ```\n\nBy following these steps, you will create a function that meets the requirements and correctly processes the input string to produce an ordered version of it.", "File list": ["main.py"], "Data structures and interfaces": "def anti_shuffle(s: str) -> str:", "Program call flow": "```sequence\nClient -> main.py: Call anti_shuffle('Hello World!!!')\nmain.py -> main.py: Split the input string into words\nmain.py -> main.py: Iterate over each word\nmain.py -> main.py: Sort the characters of each word\nmain.py -> main.py: Reconstruct the string with sorted words\nmain.py -> Client: Return the sorted string\n```", "Anything UNCLEAR": ""}, "task": {"Required packages": ["No required packages"], "Required Other language third-party packages": ["No third-party dependencies required"], "Logic Analysis": [["main.py", "Contains one function `anti_shuffle` with the same input/output format as user requirement"]], "File list": ["main.py"], "Full API spec": "", "Shared Knowledge": "", "Anything UNCLEAR": ""}, "eval_result": true}
