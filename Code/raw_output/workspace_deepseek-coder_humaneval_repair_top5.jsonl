If this product equals the input number `a`, return `True` as the result.\n   ```python\n   if i * j * k == a: return True\n   ```\n\n4. **Return false if no combination matches**:\n   If none of the combinations of three prime numbers multiply to `a`, return `False` at the end of the function.\n   ```python\n   return False\n   ```\n\nBy following these steps, you will have a complete function that meets the requirement of determining if a number is the product of three prime numbers.", "File list": ["main.py"], "Data structures and interfaces": "def is_prime(n: int) -> bool:  # Checks if a number is prime\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    if n <= 3:\n        return True\n    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:\n        return False\n    i = 5\n    while i * i <= n:\n        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:\n            return False\n        i += 6\n    return True\n\ndef is_multiply_prime(a: int) -> bool:  # Checks if a number is a product of exactly three prime numbers\n    if a < 2:\n        return False\n    primes = []\n    for i in range(2, a // 2 + 1):\n        if a % i == 0 and is_prime(i):\n            primes.append(i)\n            a //= i\n    if is_prime(a):\n        primes.append(a)\n        return len(primes) == 3\n    return False", "Program call flow": "sequenceDiagram\n    participant U as User\n    participant P as Program\n    U->>P: Input a number\n    P->>P: Call is_multiply_prime(a)\n    P->>P: Call is_prime(n)\n    P->>U: Return True or False", "Anything UNCLEAR": ""}, "task": {"Required packages": ["No required packages"], "Required Other language third-party packages": ["No third-party dependencies required"], "Logic Analysis": [["main.py", "Contains the function `is_multiply_prime(a)` which checks if a given number is the product of three prime numbers."]], "File list": ["main.py"], "Full API spec": "", "Shared Knowledge": "", "Anything UNCLEAR": ""}, "eval_result": true}

Ensure that you do not go out of bounds by checking the indices before accessing neighboring cells (up, left, down, right).\n   ```python\n               temp = []\n               if i != 0:\n                   temp.append(grid[i - 1][j])\n               if j != 0:\n                   temp.append(grid[i][j - 1])\n               if i != n - 1:\n                   temp.append(grid[i + 1][j])\n               if j != n - 1:\n                   temp.append(grid[i][j + 1])\n   ```\n\n4. **Update Minimum Neighbor Value**: After collecting the values of the neighboring cells, update `val` to be the minimum value found in `temp`.\n   ```python\n               val = min(temp)\n   ```\n\n5. **Construct the Result Path**: Initialize an empty list `ans` to hold the values of the path of length `k`. Use a loop that runs `k` times to populate this list. Alternate between appending `1` and the minimum neighbor value `val` based on whether the current index is even or odd.\n   ```python\n   ans = []\n   for i in range(k):\n       if i % 2 == 0:\n           ans.append(1)\n       else:\n           ans.append(val)\n   ```\n\n6. **Return the Result**: Finally, return the constructed list `ans`, which contains the values along the minimum path of length `k`.\n   ```python\n   return ans\n   ```", "File list": ["main.py"], "Data structures and interfaces": "def minPath(grid: List[List[int]], k: int) -> List[int]:", "Program call flow": "sequenceDiagram\n    participant User\n    participant Program\n    User->>Program: Call minPath(grid, k)\n    Program->>Program: Initialize priority queue with starting positions\n    loop For each step in path length k\n        Program->>Program: Expand paths in priority queue\n        Program->>Program: Add new paths to priority queue\n    end\n    Program->>User: Return lexicographically smallest path\n", "Anything UNCLEAR": "Clarification needed on the exact behavior of the priority queue, specifically how it handles paths of the same length but different lexicographical order."}, "task": {"Required packages": ["No required packages"], "Required Other language third-party packages": ["No third-party dependencies required"], "Logic Analysis": [["main.py", "Contains one function with the same input/output format as user requirement"]], "File list": ["main.py"], "Full API spec": "", "Shared Knowledge": "", "Anything UNCLEAR": "Clarification needed on how to start and initialize third-party libraries."}, "eval_result": true}

This will be the input for the function.\n   ```python\n   def anti_shuffle(s):\n   ```\n\n2. **Split the input string**: Use the `split(' ')` method on the input string `s` to divide the string into a list of words. This will separate the words based on spaces, and it will keep any blank spaces intact.\n   ```python\n   s.split(' ')\n   ```\n\n3. **Sort the characters in each word**: For each word in the list obtained from the split operation, apply the `sorted()` function. This function will sort the characters of each word in ascending order based on their ASCII values. Convert each word to a list of characters before sorting.\n   ```python\n   sorted(list(i))\n   ```\n\n4. **Join the sorted characters back into words**: After sorting the characters of each word, use the `join()` method to convert the sorted list of characters back into a string (word).\n   ```python\n   ''.join(sorted(list(i)))\n   ```\n\n5. **Process all words in the list**: Use a list comprehension to apply the sorting and joining steps to each word in the list generated from the split operation. This will result in a new list where each word is replaced by its sorted version.\n   ```python\n   [''.join(sorted(list(i))) for i in s.split(' ')]\n   ```\n\n6. **Join the words back into a single string**: Finally, use the `join()` method again to combine all the sorted words back into a single string, with words separated by a space.\n   ```python\n   ' '.join([...])\n   ```\n\n7. **Return the final result**: Make sure to return the final combined string from the function.\n   ```python\n   return ' '.join([...])\n   ```\n\nBy following these steps, you will achieve the desired functionality of the `anti_shuffle` function as specified in the requirement.", "File list": ["main.py"], "Data structures and interfaces": "def anti_shuffle(s: str) -> str:", "Program call flow": "sequenceDiagram\n    participant U as User\n    participant P as Program\n    U->>P: Input string 's'\n    P->>P: Split the string into words and punctuation\n    P->>P: Sort characters in each word alphabetically\n    P->>P: Join the words and punctuation back together\n    P->>U: Output the sorted string\n", "Anything UNCLEAR": "Clarification needed on the specific sorting algorithm to be used, ..."}, "task": {"Required packages": ["No required packages"], "Required Other language third-party packages": ["No third-party dependencies required"], "Logic Analysis": [["main.py", "Contains one function with the same input/output format as user requirement"]], "File list": ["main.py"], "Full API spec": "", "Shared Knowledge": "", "Anything UNCLEAR": ""}, "eval_result": true}
