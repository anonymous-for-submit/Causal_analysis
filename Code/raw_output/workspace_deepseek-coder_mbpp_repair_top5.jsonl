Set `left` to 0 (the start of the array) and `right` to the last index, which is `len(A) - 1`.\n\n   ```python\n   (left, right) = (0, len(A) - 1)\n   ```\n\n2. **Result Variable**: Create a variable `result` to store the index of the first occurrence of the number. Initialize it to -1, which will indicate that the number was not found if it remains unchanged.\n\n   ```python\n   result = -1\n   ```\n\n3. **Binary Search Loop**: Implement a while loop that continues as long as `left` is less than or equal to `right`. This loop will help in narrowing down the search space.\n\n   ```python\n   while left <= right:\n   ```\n\n4. **Calculate Midpoint**: Inside the loop, calculate the midpoint `mid` of the current search range. This can be done using integer division of the sum of `left` and `right`.\n\n   ```python\n   mid = (left + right) // 2\n   ```\n\n5. **Check Midpoint Value**: Compare the value at the midpoint `A[mid]` with the target number `x`.\n\n   - **Match Found**: If `A[mid]` is equal to `x`, it means you found a potential occurrence. Store this index in `result`. To find the first occurrence, continue searching in the left half by updating `right` to `mid - 1`.\n\n     ```python\n     if x == A[mid]:\n         result = mid\n         right = mid - 1\n     ```\n\n   - **Target is Smaller**: If `x` is less than `A[mid]`, it implies that the target number must be in the left half of the array. Update `right` to `mid - 1`.\n\n     ```python\n     elif x < A[mid]:\n         right = mid - 1\n     ```\n\n   - **Target is Larger**: If `x` is greater than `A[mid]`, update `left` to `mid + 1` to search in the right half of the array.\n\n     ```python\n     else:\n         left = mid + 1\n     ```\n\n6. **Return Result**: After the loop ends, return `result`, which will either be the index of the first occurrence of `x` or -1 if `x` was not found in the array.\n\n   ```python\n   return result\n   ```\n\nBy following these steps, you will successfully implement a function that efficiently finds the first occurrence of a number in a sorted array using binary search.", "File list": ["main.py"], "Data structures and interfaces": "def find_first_occurrence(arr: list[int], target: int) -> int:\n    # Function to find the index of the first occurrence of target in sorted array arr\n    # Input: arr (list of integers), target (integer)\n    # Output: index (integer) or -1 if target is not found", "Program call flow": "sequenceDiagram\n    participant U as User\n    participant P as Program\n    U->>P: Call find_first_occurrence([2, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 5)\n    P->>P: Initialize left = 0, right = len(arr) - 1\n    P->>P: while left <= right:\n        P->>P: mid = (left + right) // 2\n        P->>P: if arr[mid] == target and (mid == 0 or arr[mid - 1] != target):\n            P->>P: return mid\n        P->>P: elif arr[mid] < target:\n            P->>P: left = mid + 1\n        P->>P: else:\n            P->>P: right = mid - 1\n    P->>U: return -1  # Target not found", "Anything UNCLEAR": "No unclear aspects mentioned."}, "task": {"Required packages": ["No required packages"], "Required Other language third-party packages": ["No third-party dependencies required"], "Logic Analysis": [["main.py", "Contains one function with the same input/output format as user requirement"]], "File list": ["main.py"], "Full API spec": "", "Shared Knowledge": "", "Anything UNCLEAR": "No unclear aspects mentioned."}, "eval_result": true}

This function will calculate the sum of all divisors of `n`.\n   ```python\n   def div_sum(n):\n   ```\n\n3. **Initialize the Total**: Inside the `div_sum` function, initialize a variable `total` to 1. This accounts for the divisor 1, which is a divisor of every integer.\n   ```python\n       total = 1\n   ```\n\n4. **Set Up a Loop for Divisor Calculation**: Initialize a variable `i` to 2. Use a while loop to iterate while `i * i` is less than or equal to `n`. This ensures that you only check up to the square root of `n` for potential divisors.\n   ```python\n       i = 2\n       while i * i <= n:\n   ```\n\n5. **Check for Divisibility**: Within the loop, check if `n` is divisible by `i`. If it is, add both `i` and the corresponding divisor `n // i` (integer division) to the `total`. Ensure to avoid adding the same divisor twice if `i` and `n // i` are equal.\n   ```python\n           if (n % i == 0):\n               total = (total + i + math.floor(n / i))\n   ```\n\n6. **Increment the Divisor**: After checking for divisibility, increment `i` by 1 to check the next integer.\n   ```python\n           i += 1\n   ```\n\n7. **Return the Total**: After exiting the loop, return the computed `total`, which contains the sum of the divisors of `n`.\n   ```python\n       return total\n   ```\n\n8. **Define the Main Function**: Create another function called `are_equivalent` that takes two integers, `num1` and `num2`, as arguments.

Both arrays are initialized as copies of the input array `arr`.\n\n   ```python\n   MSIBS = arr[:] \n   ```\n\n2. **Calculate Maximum Sum of Increasing Subsequences**: Use a nested loop to fill `MSIBS`. The outer loop iterates through each element in the array, and the inner loop checks all previous elements. If the current element is greater than a previous element and the sum of the previous maximum sum and the current element exceeds the current maximum sum at that index, update it.\n\n   ```python\n   for i in range(len(arr)): \n       for j in range(0, i): \n           if arr[i] > arr[j] and MSIBS[i] < MSIBS[j] + arr[i]: \n               MSIBS[i] = MSIBS[j] + arr[i] \n   ```\n\n3. **Calculate Maximum Sum of Decreasing Subsequences**: Similar to the increasing subsequence calculation, use a nested loop to fill `MSDBS`. However, this time, iterate from the end of the array towards the beginning. Check if the current element (from the end) is greater than a previously checked element (also from the end) and update the maximum sum accordingly.\n\n   ```python\n   for i in range(1, len(arr) + 1): \n       for j in range(1, i): \n           if arr[-i] > arr[-j] and MSDBS[-i] < MSDBS[-j] + arr[-i]: \n               MSDBS[-i] = MSDBS[-j] + arr[-i] \n   ```\n\n4. **Combine Results to Find Maximum Bitonic Sum**: Initialize a variable `max_sum` to negative infinity. Then, iterate through the indices of the three arrays (`MSIBS`, `MSDBS`, and the original array) simultaneously. For each index, calculate the potential maximum sum of the bitonic subsequence by adding the values from `MSIBS` and `MSDBS` and subtracting the corresponding original element.

Store the initial value of `a` in a temporary variable `temp`. This will help us later when we need to determine the minimum and maximum values.\n\n   ```python\n       temp = a \n   ```\n\n3. Update `a` to hold the minimum value between `a` and `b`, and update `b` to hold the maximum value between the original `a` and `b`.

Check if the target distance `d` is greater than or equal to `b`. If it is, calculate the number of jumps needed to reach or exceed `d` using the formula `(d + b - 1) / b`. This formula accounts for the fact that partial jumps may be required.\n\n   ```python\n       if (d >= b): \n           return (d + b - 1) / b \n   ```\n\n5. Next, check if `d` is equal to `0`. If it is, return `0` since no jumps are needed to stay at the origin.\n\n   ```python\n       if (d == 0): \n           return 0\n   ```\n\n6. Then, check if `d` is equal to `a`.

This will help in setting the middle bits based on the original value of `n`.\n\n   ```python\n       n |= n >> 1; \n       n |= n >> 2; \n       n |= n >> 4; \n       n |= n >> 8; \n       n |= n >> 16;  \n   ```\n\n3. **Return modified value**: Shift `n` right by one position and perform a bitwise XOR with 1. This will prepare the value for toggling the middle bits without affecting the first and last bits.\n\n   ```python\n       return (n >> 1) ^ 1\n   ```\n\n4. **Define the main toggle function**: Create the main function `toggle_middle_bits` that will take an integer `n` as input. This function will use the helper function to perform the bit toggling.\n\n   ```python\n   def toggle_middle_bits(n): \n   ```\n\n5. **Handle edge case for small numbers**: Inside the `toggle_middle_bits` function, check if `n` is equal to 1.

This will hold the size of the largest divisible subset ending at each index.\n   ```python\n       n = len(a)\n       dp = [0 for i in range(n)]\n   ```\n\n3. **Base Case**: Set the last element of the `dp` list to 1, indicating that the smallest subset including the last element itself is of size 1.\n   ```python\n       dp[n - 1] = 1;\n   ```\n\n4. **Outer Loop**: Use a loop to iterate through the list in reverse order, starting from the second-to-last element down to the first element. This will help build the solution from the end of the list.\n   ```python\n       for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):\n   ```\n\n5. **Initialization of Maximum Size**: Inside the outer loop, initialize a variable `mxm` to keep track of the maximum size of divisible subsets found for the elements following the current element.\n   ```python\n           mxm = 0;\n   ```\n\n6. **Inner Loop**: Use another loop to check all elements that come after the current element in the outer loop. This nested loop will find all elements that can form a divisible pair with the current element.\n   ```python\n           for j in range(i + 1, n):\n   ```\n\n7. **Divisibility Check**: Inside the inner loop, check if the current element `a[i]` can form a divisible pair with `a[j]`. This can be done by checking if either `a[j] % a[i] == 0` or `a[i] % a[j] == 0`.\n   ```python\n               if a[j] % a[i] == 0 or a[i] % a[j] == 0:\n   ```\n\n8. **Update Maximum Size**: If a divisible pair is found, update `mxm` to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j]`, which represents the size of the largest subset found for element `a[j]`.\n   ```python\n                   mxm = max(mxm, dp[j])\n   ```\n\n9. **Update DP List**: After the inner loop, update `dp[i]` to be 1 plus the maximum size found (`mxm`). This accounts for the current element itself being part of the subset.\n   ```python\n           dp[i] = 1 + mxm\n   ```\n\n10. **Return Result**: Finally, return the maximum value from the `dp` list, which represents the size of the largest divisible subset.\n    ```python\n       return max(dp)\n    ```", "File list": ["main.py"], "Data structures and interfaces": "def largest_subset(numbers: List[int], divisor: int) -> int:", "Program call flow": "sequenceDiagram\n    participant User\n    participant Program\n    User->>Program: Call largest_subset([1, 3, 6, 13, 17, 18], 6)\n    Program->>Program: Initialize dp array with zeros\n    Program->>Program: Iterate over each number in numbers\n    Program->>Program: For each number, compute the remainder when divided by divisor\n    Program->>Program: Increment the count of the remainder in the dp array\n    Program->>Program: Find the maximum value in the dp array\n    Program->>User: Return 4\n", "Anything UNCLEAR": "The user has not specified any unclear aspects."}, "task": {"Required packages": ["No required packages"], "Required Other language third-party packages": ["No third-party dependencies required"], "Logic Analysis": [["main.py", "Contains one function with the same input/output format as user requirement"]], "File list": ["main.py"], "Full API spec": "", "Shared Knowledge": "", "Anything UNCLEAR": "The user has not specified any unclear aspects."}, "eval_result": true}
