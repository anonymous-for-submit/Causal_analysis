There is a telephone pole at (x, y) if a_{x, y} = 1. For each point (x, y), define S(x, y) as the square of the Euclidean distance between the nearest pole and (x, y). Formally, the square of the Euclidean distance between two points (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2) is (x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2. To optimize the building plan, the project supervisor asks you the sum of all S(x, y) for each 0 ≤ x ≤ n and 0 ≤ y ≤ m. Help him by finding the value of ∑_{x=0}^{n} {∑_{y=0}^{m} {S(x, y)}}.
